<strong>Presentation</strong>: Award-winning architect and environmental consultant <a href="http://community.ata.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Bio_Mahalath_Halperin.pdf">Mahalath Halperin</a> will speak on the practice and evolution of sustainable housing. The first part of Mahalath’s address will look at several case studies and the retrofitting of existing houses as well as a new build. She will discuss ideas and options on using passive solar design, and what to do to make your home more energy efficient and environmentally friendly within the limits of existing buildings and budgets. The second part of the seminar will focus on the beauty of sustainable design with a visual journey of how our buildings have been shaped through history first by renewable energy and now by technology and lifestyle expectations. Based in Armidale, NSW, Mahalath is an accredited carbon management and energy assessor, and she says “years of monitoring my home and office has provided an interesting insight into the comparison between theory and reality”. Mahalath advocates a reconnection with our climate, coupled with the ability of renewable energy and technology to meet the demands of our modern lifestyle, and to re-shape our buildings resulting in homes that are warmer in winter, cooler in summer and generally just nicer to live in.<br />

We are grateful to the Toowoomba Solar Centre for their support of this event.</p>
