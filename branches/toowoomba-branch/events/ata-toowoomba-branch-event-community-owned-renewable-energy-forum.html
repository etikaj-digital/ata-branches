<p><strong>Presentation</strong>: Community Owned Renewable Energy Forum</p>

<p>There has been much controversy in recent months about energy security and the role of renewables. While politicians have bickered, communities are taking their energy needs into their own hands.</p>

<p>There are many options for community owned renewable energy. This meeting will look at some of the successful community energy models that are already operating across the country.</p>

<p>One model in regional NSW has a local cooperative installing solar panels on businesses and letting them use the energy generated for a cheaper price. The money comes back to the cooperative to pay for the investment and provide a dividend which might then be used for community energy efficiency education. See <a href="https://www.repower.net.au">Repower Shoalhaven</a>.</p>

<p>Another in the Northern Rivers has local investors establishing an energy retailer in competition with other established retailers such as AGL and Origin, providing less expensive energy and returning funds to the community. See <a href="https://enovaenergy.com.au">Enova Energy</a>.</p>

<p>One Melbourne Council has a program for assisting low income households, such as pensioners, put in rooftop solar panels with the repayments made with the rates. See <a href="http://www.darebin.vic.gov.au/Darebin-Living/Caring-for-the-environment/EnergyClimate">Darebin Council Solar Saver Program</a>.</p>

<p>Not only are there financial benefits of these programs, the communities in which they take place are empowered and energised by their involvement.</p>

<p>At this Community Owned Renewable Energy Forum, the community has an opportunity to hear in more detail about these exciting developments. This is also a chance for Toowoomba and the Darling Downs to be part of a national community energy initiative.</p>

<p>We look forward to seeing you there,</p>
