<p><strong>Presentation</strong>: <strong>Smart Residential Development – New directions in innovative, sustainable, affordable housing.</strong></p>

<p>We have teamed up with Toowoomba Regional Council &amp; the University of Southern Qld for this event in order to get our message out to a broader audience and we\'re are optimistic that there will be a big roll up.</p>

<p>The speaker will be Michael Kane who is the Assistant Director Environment and Innovation at Economic Development Qld. Michael has been involved in some innovative new housing developments which include solar PV, the use of phase change materials and installation of monitoring equipment to assess the performance of these houses.</p>

<p>Hope to see you there for our final presentation for 2015.</p>

<p>We are also planning to hold an AGM in November. This will be a chance for members to get together over dinner and discuss our direction for next year. More to come on this also once we have a date &amp; venue.</p>

<p>Ross Campbell<br />
