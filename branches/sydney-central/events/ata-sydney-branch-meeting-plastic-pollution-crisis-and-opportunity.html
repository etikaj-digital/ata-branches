<p>Waste and recycling is a hot topic at the moment and it seems that every week we hear of some shortfall within our current waste management system – construction and demolition materials dumped in Queensland, China refusing to accept our waste products for recycling and even large recycling contractors cancelling contracts with Local Councils.  We have been under the impression that by recycling and being careful about sorting our waste that our impacts on the environment are being minimised - this is in fact not yet the case.</p>

<p>This month we have the very experienced environmental campaigner Jeff Angel from the Total Environment Centre reviewing this topic &amp; we are hoping that his presentation will spark a lively discussion. If you have ideas and thoughts about what we should be doing with our waste, come along and join in!</p>

<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b>TALK TOPIC:  </b>Plastic Pollution<b> </b>- Crisis and Opportunity. Pollution of the ocean and land with macro and micro plastic is a serious problem, not only harming marine life but also finding its way into our food supplies.  Easily disposable plastics have become an ingrained part of our materials use, so now we face the challenge of developing actions and strategies to ensure that our society\'s plastic materials don\'t continue to adversely affect the environment.</p>

<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b>SPEAKER </b><b>BIO:</b> Jeff Angel is Executive Director of Total Environment Centre and the Boomerang Alliance and been an active environmentalist for over 40 years.  He has coordinated and been a key spokesperson for a number of high profile projects and campaigns including:</p>

<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b>DIRECTIONS AND FURTHER DETAILS:</b></p>

<p>Please arrive at 6:00pm for a 6:30pm start.</p>

<p>The Interface head office and showroom is located within the heritage-listed<a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/search/Interface+surry+hills/@-33.887304,151.202602,15z?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 101 Chalmers Street building</a> in Sydney.  Access from Central Station involves turning right as you leave the Devonshire St exit, and then a short walk with a second, almost immediate right - if you get to Prince Alfred Park you have gone too far!</p>

<p>Look for a two-storey red brick and sandstone building that adjoins a single-storey library, known as the ‘Railway Institute Building’.  Entrance is through clear glass doors at the rear of this building that has been faithfully restored and redesigned with stunning interiors, turning it into a showcase of environmental sustainability.  Due to our proximity to Central Station, we encourage attendees to catch public transport to this event as nearby parking is limited.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee and tasty snacks are available before and after the talk, with donations gratefully accepted.</p>
