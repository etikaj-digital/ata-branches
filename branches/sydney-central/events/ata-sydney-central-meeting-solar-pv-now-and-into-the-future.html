<p dir="ltr">Stefan Jarnason has been a pioneer in the development of the solar PV industry in Australia. His 20 years of industry experience includes research, product development, PV panel manufacturing, PV system design, large-scale project development and now solar PV monitoring. Co-founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.solaranalytics.com.au">Solar Analytics</a>, Stefan leads a team of engineers and developers in providing customers with detailed and actionable information on the performance of their solar PV systems. Stefan’s passion for all things solar is a driving force amongst the team.</p>

<div>There are over 1.5 million solar systems installed on residential homes around Australia. And this year another 140,000 are expected to be installed. Collectively they are providing increasing proportion of our energy usage and are now a common feature of many homes. What is less well known is that approximately half of these solar systems are generating less energy than they should with an average performance of only 81% of optimal. Even worse almost no-one knows if their system is under-performing or what to do to about it. This unknown underperformance will become an even greater issue as we enter the battery boom era.  Battery storage costs are plummeting rapidly, with the likes of Tesla, LG, Bosch, Panasonic all spending billions of dollars on bringing energy storage to our homes. This will utterly revolutionise how we generate and use our electricity. It will begin as a trickle in 2016 and develop into a tsunami over the next 5-10 years.</p>

<div>This talk, by one of the pioneers of our solar industry, will discuss what the increased uptake solar means, how to maximise the value you get from your solar system, and what changes we will see this year and in the future to how we generate and use solar energy.</div>

<p><strong>Directions and further details</strong>:</p>

<p>Please arrive at 6:00pm for a 6:30pm start.</p>

<p>The Interface head office and showroom is located within the heritage-listed <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/search/Interface+surry+hills/@-33.887304,151.202602,15z?hl=en">101 Chalmers Street building</a> in Sydney.  Access from Central Station involves turning right as you leave the Devonshire St exit, and then a short walk with a second, almost immediate right - if you get to to Prince Alfred Park you have gone too far!</p>

<p>Look for a two-storey red brick and sandstone building that adjoins a single-storey library, known as the ‘Railway Institute Building’. Entrance is at the rear of this building that has been faithfully restored and redesigned with stunning interiors, turning it into a showcase of environmental sustainability.  Due to our proximity to Central Station, we encourage attendees to catch public transport to this event as nearby parking is limited.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee and tasty snacks are available before and after the talk, with donations gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>The ATA is an independent organisation that does not endorse products and seeks to provide members with information so that they can make well-informed sustainable decisions.</p>

<p>Thanks for your ongoing support of the ATA Sydney Central Branch.</p>
