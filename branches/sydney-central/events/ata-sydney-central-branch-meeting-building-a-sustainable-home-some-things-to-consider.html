        <p><b>When: </b>Tuesday 13th May, 6:00pm for 6:30pm</p>

<p><b>Where: </b>Wallaby Room, 11th Floor, Telstra Building, 320 Pitt St Sydney</p>

<p><b>Speaker</b>:<b><a href="http://www.gehunt.com.au" target="_blank"> Graham Hunt</a>, Architect</p>

<p></b>Graham Hunt uses his extensive experience in sustainable design to holistically conceive stimulating, healthy and resource-efficient buildings. Graham designed and built his first passive solar home in 1983 and specialises in optimising thermal comfort. Beginning with realistic and pragmatic site evaluation, Graham uses deep consultation with clients to develop cost-effective design solutions full of delight. Graham is based in the Inner West and works as a sole practitioner with accreditation as a Thermal Performance Assessor and Green Star Professional who collaborates with and consults to other architects on energy efficiency and thermal comfort.</p>

<p><b>Talk summary:</b> This presentation will outline the many elements of undertaking a sustainable renovation or new home build. Graham will overview the process from how to get underway, to refining design considerations and the ongoing management to ensure that what gets built matches the initial intention. The talk will cover the following key considerations:</p>

<ul>

<li>Where to start and who do you get involved?</li>

<li>What technologies and sustainable features should you include?</li>

<li>Thermal performance assessment - how to use it to optimise design not just as a compliance requirement - how it relates to real world situations and individual preferences</li>

<li>Detailed examination of the components that affect thermal comfort i.e. glazing, thermal mass, insulation, ventilation etc.</li>

<li>The importance of minimising waste and maximising re-use and recycling</li>

<li>How to stay engaged throughout the building process</li>

</ul>
