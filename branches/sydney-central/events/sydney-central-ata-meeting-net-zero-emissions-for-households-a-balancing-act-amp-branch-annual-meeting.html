<p><b>Presentation:  </b>John Caley is Director of Engineering at Ecological Design, a consultancy which provides sustainable design and assessment services for residential and commercial projects.  Ecological Design uses a range of computer simulation tools to more accurately model the relative performance of  architectural designs.  This process involves improving crucial design aspects such as thermal performance by optimising insulation and glazing, specifying heating and cooling systems, ensuring the best fit for solar PV as well as specifying rainwater tank systems.  Ecological Design is focused on specifying well-researched, practical, cost-effective, sustainable solutions and prides itself on the independent basis of all advice.</p>

<p><b>Talk summary:</b>  How do you manage the large energy uses within a household and match the energy demand with solar PV?  John will talk through his experience on a range of projects and how you can optimise a home design and select a solar PV system to achieve zero net energy. If you have ever wanted to make a house work better or are looking to either design and renovate then this talk will provide the practical information that will take your design thinking around energy use to the next level.</p>

<p>Members and non-members are asked to register by selecting ATTEND at: <a href="http://atasydney.eventbrite.com.au/">atasydney.eventbrite.com.au</a></p>

<p><strong>We will also be running a brief Annual Meeting and introducing our revamped committee for 2015/16.</strong></p>

<p><b>Directions and further details:</b></p>

<p>Please arrive at 6:00pm for a 6:30pm start. The Interface head office and showroom is located within the heritage-listed <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/search/Interface+surry+hills/@-33.887304,151.202602,15z?hl=en">101 Chalmers Street building</a> in Sydney. Access from Central Station involves turning right as you leave the Devonshire St. exit, and then a short walk with a second, almost immediate right - if you get to to Prince Alfred Park you have gone too far!</p>

<p>Look for a two-storey red brick and sandstone building that adjoins a single-storey library, known as the ‘Railway Institute Building’. Entrance is at the rear of this building that has been faithfully restored and redesigned with stunning interiors, turning it into a showcase of environmental sustainability.</p>

<p>The Interface head office and showroom is just a short walk from Central Station, we encourage attendees to catch public transport to this event as nearby parking is limited.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee and tasty snacks are available before and after the talk, with gold coin donations gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>The ATA is an independent organisation that does not endorse products and seeks to provide members with information so that they can make well-informed sustainable decisions.</p>
