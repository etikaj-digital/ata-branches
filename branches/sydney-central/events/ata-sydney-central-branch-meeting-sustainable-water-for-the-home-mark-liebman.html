<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Mark Liebman of <a href="http://www.sustainabilityworkshop.com">Sustainability Workshop</a></p>

<p><strong>Talk summary: </strong><b>Sustainable Water for the Home – Mark Liebman</b></p>

<p>Mark will cover the following :-</p>

<ul>

<li>The evolution of Sydney as a water sensitive city</li>

<li>Water sensitive urban design</li>

<li>Urban heating cooling and the role water can play in adapting to climate change</li>

<li>Rainwater tanks – how to model – go through a tankulator example.</li>

<li>Rainwater regulations</li>

<li>Grey water – options for reuse and regulations</li>

<li>Raingardens</li>

<li>Permeable pavers</li>

<li>How to integrate it all together</li>

</ul>

<p>Mark has over 20 years professional experience as a Civil &amp; Environmental Engineer who has operated on the cutting edge for most of that time.  In the early days he worked alongside Michael Mobbs and Ecological Homes and other pioneers to bring Alternative “water” technology into the mainstream.  He butted heads with Sydney Water over the Elambra Estate at Gerringong which was the first Estate to mandate the use of rainwater tanks in NSW.  Since then Mark has helped pioneer stormwater harvesting and the use of bioretention to treat stormwater to a high quality.  He is currently planning the design of his own house on a quarter acre block in the Blue mountains and intends for it to be off grid for both water and energy.  To get his house off grid for water he will need to don his well-worn battle fatigues one more time.</p>

<p><strong>Directions and further details</strong>:</p>

<p>Please arrive at 6:00pm for a 6:30pm start.</p>

<p>The Interface head office and showroom is located within the heritage-listed <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/search/Interface+surry+hills/@-33.887304,151.202602,15z?hl=en">101 Chalmers Street building</a> in Sydney.  Access from Central Station involves turning right as you leave the Devonshire St exit, and then a short walk with a second, almost immediate right - if you get to to Prince Alfred Park you have gone too far!</p>

<p>Look for a two-storey red brick and sandstone building that adjoins a single-storey library, known as the ‘Railway Institute Building’. Entrance is at the rear of this building that has been faithfully restored and redesigned with stunning interiors, turning it into a showcase of environmental sustainability.  Due to our proximity to Central Station, we encourage attendees to catch public transport to this event as nearby parking is limited.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee and tasty snacks are available before and after the talk, with donations gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>The ATA is an independent organisation that does not endorse products and seeks to provide members with information so that they can make well-informed sustainable decisions.</p>
