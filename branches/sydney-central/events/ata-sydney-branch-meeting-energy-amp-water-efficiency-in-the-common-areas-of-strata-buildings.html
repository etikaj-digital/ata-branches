<p>New apartment buildings are filling the Sydney skyline and as more and more of us are living in them, this month we turn our focus to some of the ecological challenges of this housing type.  Our speaker Ethan Burns from Sustainability Now will present on the topic of <strong>Energy &amp; water efficiency in the common areas of strata buildings</strong></p>

<p>In his talk, Ethan will cover the following:</p>

<ul>

<li>What changes can be made to improve the sustainability of common areas</li>

<li>Things to consider about using solar technologies, making energy efficiency changes and water use</li>

<li>How to make savings in electricity and gas use in common areas</li>

<li>How to make changes happen</li>

<li>Key barriers to change and how to overcome them</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong> After 10 years in the electricity generation, transmission &amp; distribution industry and a brief stint in local government, Ethan Burns founded Sustainability Now in 2009 through a personal need to make a positive impact through improving his customers\' energy efficiency and environmental performance.  He is predominantly a consultant, but also project manages implementation of energy efficiency opportunities and trains customers in energy efficiency and environmental management.  Ethan works predominantly with residential strata complexes, local &amp; state governments and has been a key consultant partner in:</p>

<ul>

<li>The City of Sydney Smart Green Apartments Program</li>

<li>Ku-ring-gai Council Smart Units Program</li>

<li>Development of the new NABERS tool for residential strata in conjunction with the NSW Office of Environment &amp; Heritage</li>

</ul>

<p>Ethan is also a regular contributor to the Alternative Technology Association\'s (ATA) \'Speed-date a Sustainability Consultant\'.  He has a Bachelor of Engineering with First Class Honours from Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia. His areas of specialist knowledge include; energy efficiency &amp; energy efficient lighting, renewable energy, environmental management, training and project management.</p>

<p><strong>Directions and further details</strong>:</p>

<p>Please arrive at 6:00pm for a 6:30pm start.</p>

<p>The Interface head office and showroom is located within the heritage-listed <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/search/Interface+surry+hills/@-33.887304,151.202602,15z?hl=en">101 Chalmers Street building</a> in Sydney.  Access from Central Station involves turning right as you leave the Devonshire St exit, and then a short walk with a second, almost immediate right - if you get to to Prince Alfred Park you have gone too far!</p>

<p>Look for a two-storey red brick and sandstone building that adjoins a single-storey library, known as the ‘Railway Institute Building’. Entrance is at the rear of this building that has been faithfully restored and redesigned with stunning interiors, turning it into a showcase of environmental sustainability.  Due to our proximity to Central Station, we encourage attendees to catch public transport to this event as nearby parking is limited.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee and tasty snacks are available before and after the talk, with donations gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>The ATA is an independent organisation that does not endorse products and seeks to provide members with information so that they can make well-informed sustainable decisions.</p>
