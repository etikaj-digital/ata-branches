<p><strong>Presentation:</strong></p>

<p>Have you ever wanted to know how to build an ecovillage or are interested in living in one? This month we are featuring <a href="https://nararaecovillage.com/">Narara Ecovillage</a> (NEV) which aims to research, design and build a stylish, inter-generational and friendly demonstration ecovillage that blends the principles of ecological and social sustainability along with systems of good health, business, caring, ethical governance and the capacity to continue to evolve. Come and listen to Tony Hester (site manager at NEV) and Grant Rickey (Board and Project Control group member) present on this bold and inspiring vision.</p>

<p>The NEV Co-operative currently consists of around 80 families and after much hard work, the first sub-division has been completed and the construction of the first houses will start soon. The ecovillage is located in an extraordinary bushland setting nestled in the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Narara+Eco+Village/@-33.391154,151.328096,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xf6ac4eb03f77413b!8m2!3d-33.391154!4d151.328096">Narara Valley</a> on the Central Coast.</p>

<p>The ecovillage will incorporate a solar mini-grid, an independent water supply and on-site sewage treatment to provide recycled water for use in gardens and houses. Tony &amp; Grant’s presentation will begin with a general introduction to the development of the ecovillage and then dig into detail on a range of topics including; the infrastructure development timeline, sustainable building standards &amp; systems, governance structures, volunteer coordination, master planning &amp; next steps as well as maintaining community cohesion &amp; resolving conflict.</p>

<p>Narara Ecovillage is asking us to “Imagine a group of people of all ages, living sustainably as a thriving community in a contemporary development near Sydney – having fun, living lightly, being connected…”</p>
