<p><strong>Presentation:</strong> For most electricity consumers a quarterly or monthly utility bill is still the best indication they get of their power consumption. Compare that to what your telco and smartphone offer and you\'ll see how far the energy industry must evolve to fully embrace its digital revolution.<br />

As CEO of Sydney-based Wattwatchers, Gavin Dietz has a vision for energy and data that aims to smash the old model of a gold-plated, highly centralised, supply-dominated electricity market forever. Rising in its place is a new order of:<br />

• Consumers empowered by unprecedented access to their energy data<br />

• Monitoring and control of electrical circuits in real-time over the internet<br />

• Opening up a dynamic new marketplace \'behind the utility meter\', and<br />

• Further accelerating the integration of distributed energy resources</p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Gavin Dietz, CEO, Wattwatchers is an information technologist with a history in large-scale startups including Fox and News Limited in Australia. He was a founder member of Bayard Capital, which from 2003 purchased and merged 14 smart metering technology companies and in 2011 sold the rolled-up entity Landis + Gyr to Toshiba for $US2.3 billion. Gavin was global CIO for Landis + Gyr, the world’s largest meter manufacturer, from 2005 to 2014. He was a founding shareholder of Mammoth Pets, now publicly listed as Greencross Vets/Pet Barn. Gavin joined Sydney-based Wattwatchers in 2016 to lead its growth phase.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wattwatchers.com.au">Wattwatchers </a>is embracing this future with its \'Energy Data Hub\' path, enabling electricity consumers to buy, generate, use, manage and share or sell power according to their own best interests. Faster and fairer access to better data will drive innovation for the clean energy transition.</p>
