<p><strong>Jonathan Prendergast</strong></p>

<p>Jonathan did a double degree of Engineering and Commerce at Melbourne University, worked at first as an engineer and project manager out of university. When working for VicUrban, he cut his teeth on his first energy project, developing the Dandenong Precinct Energy Project which includes 2 MW of Cogeneration and 1km of insulated heating pipework to supply future buildings as part of the Dandenong urban regeneration project.</p>

<p>Since moving to Sydney, he has worked as an independent energy consultant for property developers, councils and large energy users aiming to reduce energy costs and emissions, including clients such as Bendigo bank and City of Sydney. Jonathan loves innovating and turning theory into practice, and in 2015 this saw him conceive and implement Australia’s first offsite solar corporate PPA for UTS. He also recently lead UTS to sourcing 4.5MW of cooling from Central Park across Broadway to meets its Central Plant cooling needs, on to tender for a large scale corporate PPA.</p>

<p>Jonathan now lives in the Sutherland Shire with his young family. Since moving from inner city apartments, to a suburban detached house, he has retrofitting LED lighting, heat pump and a large 7.8 kilowatt solar system. He has also founded a Community Energy Group in May this year, Sunny Shire, who has started their activities with a rooftop solar bulk buy for households. Currently 160kW has been installed, looking to reach 300kW by the end of the year.</p>

<p><strong>Topic : My experience with Heat Pumps? or \'How to save money with hot water heat pumps?\'</strong></p>

<p>In September 2015, Jonathan\'s family\'s hot water stopped working. Luckily, he had been investigating switching to heat pumps, and was able to get his family to accept 5 days of cold showers while he organised a heat pump and new tank shipped from Dandenong. Jonathan\'s experience in investing in, and tracking costs and savings of his heat pump have since been published in Renew magazine. He will present his findings, as well as the broader discussion of households moving from gas to efficient electric homes, and how this works in practice.</p>

<p><strong>Oliver Joss – Technical Manager – Renewables </strong><strong>Stiebel Eltron (Aust) Pty Ltd</strong></p>

<p>With more than 29 years’ experience in the HVAC industry, Oliver brings his expertise to the Australian building industry. Oliver’s qualifications include a degree as Heating Installation Designer, HVAC Engineer and Executive MBA in Service Management. As head of technology and product management at Stiebel Eltron Switzerland he was leading their in-house academy, a training facility for in-depth industry knowledge on energy, heating and ventilation. With Australia becoming increasingly more aware of renewable solutions, he has recently joined the local team to offer his expertise in heat pump technology and ventilation.</p>

<p><strong>Topic:  </strong><strong>Innovative Heat Pump and Ventilation Technology for the House of the Future</strong></p>

<p>Fossil fuels are in decline on the global electricity market – being too harmful to the climate and ever more scarce. Nowadays, alternative energies using the sun, wind and water are being used to generate green power and achieve independence from fossil fuels. It is only logical to act in good time to convert the largest energy consumer in our homes – the heating system – to these futureproof forms of energy. As nearly 62 % of energy consumed in the home is used for heating and hot water, this makes perfect sense. There is plenty of scope for implementing the energy transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energies in Australian homes. Hydronic heat pumps use energy from the ground or air to provide environmentally friendly and comfortable central heating.</p>

<p>Oliver will explain why hydronic heat pumps present an innovative heating solution for the house of the future.:</p>

<ul>

<li>How does a heat pump actually work?</li>

<li>What types of heat pumps are in the market, and which one is the most efficient in Australia’s climate?</li>

<li>What do I need to consider when choosing a heat pump system?</li>

<li>Taking it a step further: connecting a heat pump to your home energy management system</li>

<li>Introducing case studies: air source and geothermal heat pumps in Australia</li>

<li>Heat pumps are powered by electricity, why are they good for the environment?</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Directions and further details</strong>:</p>

<p>Please arrive at 6:00pm for a 6:30pm start.</p>

<p>The Interface head office and showroom is located within the heritage-listed <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/search/Interface+surry+hills/@-33.887304,151.202602,15z?hl=en">101 Chalmers Street building</a> in Sydney.  Access from Central Station involves turning right as you leave the Devonshire St exit, and then a short walk with a second, almost immediate right - if you get to to Prince Alfred Park you have gone too far!</p>

<p>Look for a two-storey red brick and sandstone building that adjoins a single-storey library, known as the ‘Railway Institute Building’. Entrance is at the rear of this building that has been faithfully restored and redesigned with stunning interiors, turning it into a showcase of environmental sustainability.  Due to our proximity to Central Station, we encourage attendees to catch public transport to this event as nearby parking is limited.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee and tasty snacks are available before and after the talk, with donations gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>The ATA is an independent organisation that does not endorse products and seeks to provide members with information so that they can make well-informed sustainable decisions.</p>
