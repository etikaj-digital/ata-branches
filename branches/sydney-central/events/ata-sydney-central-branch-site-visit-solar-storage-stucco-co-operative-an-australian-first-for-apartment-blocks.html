<strong>Where: NOTE - change of venue.  </strong>STUCCO Housing Cooperative at 197-207 Wilson St, Newtown (click here for a <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps?q=stucco+housing+cooperative&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU_4jxtfjSAhUHj1QKHQ1eD60Q_AUICigD">map</a>).<br />

<strong>Cost</strong>: We will be asking participants for a $5 donation that will go towards STUCCO to fund an energy monitor that provides real-time energy usage of the solar and storage system.</p>

<p>We are mixing it up this month as we leave our usual venue to go out on a site tour to see some solar and storage in action!  Our venue is <strong><a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps?q=stucco+housing+cooperative&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU_4jxtfjSAhUHj1QKHQ1eD60Q_AUICigD">STUCCO Housing Cooperative </a></strong>at 197-207 Wilson St, Newtown. The site is easily accessible either from Redfern or Macdonaldtown train stations or the Wilson St. Cycleway with on-street parking also available nearby.  It is a measure of how far we have come to be able to see solar + storage projects come to life.  If you know anybody who lives in apartment and has been saying that they would like to see to see a solar + storage project happen where they live, make sure they come along to this!</p>

<p><strong>Talk summary:</strong></p>

<p>Currently, around three quarters of inner Sydney residents live in apartments and are thereby locked out of accessing solar power.  The Solar + Storage project at <a href="http://www.stucco.org.au/">Stucco Co-operative</a> is changing this!  The co-op, made up of 40 students across eight units, took control of its energy supply by becoming an embedded network and installing 30 kW of solar and 43 kWh of battery storage.  This renewable energy system now supplies 80% of the total buildings electricity needs, and across the year the solar system produces more energy than is consumed locally, making the building carbon negative.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr Bjorn Sturmberg</p>

<p>Dr Sturmberg was awarded an ARENA scholarship for his PhD research at University of Sydney, which culminated in a thesis entitled "The optical physics of dielectric nanostructures: enabling improved photovoltaic designs". He is now an associate lecturer at Macquarie University and a director of Kairos Power, an engineering consultancy whose projects include multi-million dollar hybrid micro-grids and embedded networks.</p>

<p>In 2016 he co-initiated and managed the first installation of a Solar + Storage system in an Australian apartment block. This development, at Stucco Co-operative, won an Environmental Performance - Innovation Grant from the City of Sydney. In 2017 he launched the social enterprise SunTenants to bring the solar revolution to Australian rental properties.</p>
