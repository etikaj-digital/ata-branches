        <p>Sam Paterson is the project director of the 2012-2013 Sunswift World Solar Challenge team and has been with the team since the 2009 race. In 2010-2011, Sam organised for Sunswift IVy to break the Guinness World Record for fastest solar powered vehicle, a title which the team retains. Sam has been one of the driving forces taking the team in its new direction towards a more practical solar car.</p>

<p>This presentation will give a personalised account of the amazing Sunswift story. Solar electric vehicles are making the quantum leap from being mere experiments to becoming a practical reality as part of the worldwide electric vehicle revolution.</p>

<p>The talk will focus on the following:</p>

<p>1) The evolution of the eVe solar car and our experience in the World Solar Challenge</p>

<p>2) eVe: design philosophy, design overview (aerodynamic, electrical and mechanical systems)</p>

<p>3) Vision for eVe and potential future applications of developing technology</p>
