<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr Fred Moshiri received his B.E. degree in Civil Engineering in 2006, and the MSc. Degree in Timber Engineering from the Linnaeus University, Sweden, in 2009 as well as his PhD in 2014. He has more than 5 years of experience in design and construction management of different projects with exposure to analysis, design and project planning of reinforced concrete, steel and timber buildings. He has been actively involved in research and development for Australian Timber Industry since 2010. His PhD, funded by Structural Timber Innovation Company, focused on the structural behaviour of timber concrete composite connections and floors to enable timber composite floors to compete more effectively in the building and construction market.</p>

<p><strong>Talk summary:</strong>  Why Wood You?  All You Need to Know about Using Timber in Construction</p>

<p>Fred will use recent examples of multi-storey timber apartment and office buildings projects in Australia to illustrate the design, structural performance and cost effectiveness of timber construction.  Specifically he will cover:</p>

<p>•    the advantages and opportunities for using timber in construction<br />

•    how to specify the right timber for the job<br />

•    innovations in using engineered timber structural elements in multi-storey buildings<br />

•    changes to the BCA for timber building systems in apartment, hotel and office buildings which allow construction up to 25 metres in effective height.</p>

<p><strong>Directions and further details</strong>:</p>

<p>Please arrive at 6:00pm for a 6:30pm start.</p>

<p>The Interface head office and showroom is located within the heritage-listed <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/search/Interface+surry+hills/@-33.887304,151.202602,15z?hl=en">101 Chalmers Street building</a> in Sydney.  Access from Central Station involves turning right as you leave the Devonshire St exit, and then a short walk with a second, almost immediate right - if you get to to Prince Alfred Park you have gone too far!</p>

<p>Look for a two-storey red brick and sandstone building that adjoins a single-storey library, known as the ‘Railway Institute Building’. Entrance is at the rear of this building that has been faithfully restored and redesigned with stunning interiors, turning it into a showcase of environmental sustainability.  Due to our proximity to Central Station, we encourage attendees to catch public transport to this event as nearby parking is limited.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee and tasty snacks are available before and after the talk, with donations gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>The ATA is an independent organisation that does not endorse products and seeks to provide members with information so that they can make well-informed sustainable decisions.</p>

<p>Thanks for your ongoing support of the ATA Sydney Central Branch.</p>
