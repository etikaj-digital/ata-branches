<p style="color: #1a1a1a"><span><b>Speaker:</b> </span>Dick Clarke is principal of Envirotecture, and an Accredited Building Designer with over 35 years experience, focusing exclusively on ecologically sustainable and culturally appropriate buildings, as well as sustainable design in vehicles and vessels. He has received many Design Awards.</p>

<p>He is Director of Sustainability, and Past President of the NSW Chapter of Building Designers Australia (BDA). He is a Past President and Board Member of the Association of Building Sustainability Assessors (ABSA). He has been design director of many hundreds of projects over 35 years, with sustainability as the major driver over that whole period (with the ever-changing understanding of what sustainability is), and his work has covered a wide variety of project sizes and types. Dick has edited the sought after book for designers, builders and home-owners, <a href="http://rethinkbuildingmaterials.com.au"><span style="color: #021eaa">How to Rethink Building Materials</span></a>.</p>

<p><span style="color: #1a1a1a"><b>Talk summary:</b></span> Dick will talk about how locational context and availability of materials steers the choice of construction system - a case study of two different sites, two different builders and very different buildings, with the same low embodied energy, and net low energy and water impact results.</p>

<p>Members and non-members are asked to register by selecting ATTEND at: <a href="http://atasydney.eventbrite.com.au"><span style="color: #021eaa">atasydney.eventbrite.com.au</span></a></p>

<p>Please arrive at 6:00pm for a 6:30pm start.</p>

<p><strong>Getting there:</strong> The Interface head office and showroom are located within the heritage-listed <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/search/Interface+surry+hills/@-33.887304,151.202602,15z?hl=en"><span style="color: #021eaa">101 Chalmers Street building</span></a> in Sydney. Access from Central Station involves turning right as you leave the Devonshire St exit, and then a short walk with a second, almost immediate right - if you get to Prince Alfred Park you have gone too far!  Look for a two-storey red brick and sandstone building that adjoins a single-storey library, known as the ‘Railway Institute Building’. Entrance is at the rear of this building that has been faithfully restored and redesigned with stunning interiors, turning it into a showcase of environmental sustainability.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee and tasty snacks are available before and after the talk, with gold coin donations gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>The ATA is an independent organisation that does not endorse products and seeks to provide members with information so that they can make well-informed sustainable decisions.</p>
