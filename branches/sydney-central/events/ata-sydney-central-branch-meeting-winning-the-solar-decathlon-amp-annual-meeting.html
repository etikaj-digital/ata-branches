<p><strong>Topic: </strong><a href="http://www.illawarraflame.com.au">Illawarra Flame</a> - How to Win a Solar Decathlon with a Retrofitted Fibro House</p>

<p><strong>Speaker Name: </strong>Lloyd Niccol</p>

<p>The Solar Decathlon has been dubbed the \'Energy Olympics\' for houses. The Illawarra Flame project brought home the gold by winning the competition in Datong, China in August 2013. The lessons from this journey are even more remarkable as they worked to retrofit an existing fibro house from Wollongong into the winning design. This talk complements presentations by Graham Hunt and Darryn Parkinson earlier this year as we continue to explore the use of materials and the elements of passive design, solar energy harvesting, water efficiency and advanced ventilation systems that make for world beating renovations and new dwellings.</p>

<p><strong>Bio</strong>:  Throughout 2012 and 2013 Lloyd was the Project Manager of Team University of Wollongong (UOW) Australia, the winner of Solar Decathlon 2013 in China. The Solar Decathlon is the world’s largest, student-led, sustainable building competition where students design, build and operate a net-zero energy solar powered house. Lloyd has a background in mechanical engineering and currently works as the Building Products and Solutions Leader within the Innovation team at BlueScope Steel. He has spent the past year working on Building Integrated Photovoltaic and Photovoltaic Thermal roofing products for the retrofit and new build markets.</p>

<p>In addition to winning the Solar Decathlon competition, Team UOW was also the recipient of the Australasian and International Green Gown Award for Student Initiative, finalists in the Hills Young Australian Design Awards, finalists in the Engineers Australia Engineering Excellence Awards (Sydney Division) and winners of the AIRAH Dennis Joseph Award for Innovative use of Solar in HVAC.</p>

<p><strong>Talk summary:</strong> Lloyd’s talk will focus on the Solar Decathlon Competition and Team UOW’sIllawarra Flame house which is a demonstration of how we can retrofit existing homes within Australia, in this case a 1960’s fibro house, in order to decrease the energy consumption and improve the liveability of our existing housing stock. Team UOW was a unique collaboration of over 50 students and staff from the University of Wollongong, TAFE Illawarra and Australian industry.</p>

<p>The Illawarra Flame emphasises passive design, solar energy harvesting, water efficiency and advanced ventilation systems. The house was built by students with assistance from tradesmen over a 12 week period in Australia. The home was then dismantled and shipped to China where it was reassembled over a ten day period before competing against 20 teams from around the world across diverse categories such as Architecture, Solar Application, Energy Balance and Entertainment. The event in China was attended by nearly 300,000 visitors with over 35,000 people making their way through the home in only 8 days. The house has since been shipped back to Australia where it is now on display at University of Wollongong’s Innovation Campus.</p>

<p>The talk will focus on:</p>

<ol>

<li>The background of the Solar Decathlon Competition</li>

<li>An overview of Team UOW and the University of Wollongong’s Sustainable Buildings Research Centre</li>

<li>The challenges, in particular the need to ship the home to China and assemble it in under 10 days</li>

<li>The Illawarra Flame design concept and features, including:</li>
