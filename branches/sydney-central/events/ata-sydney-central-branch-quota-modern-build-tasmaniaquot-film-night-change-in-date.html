<strong>Cost</strong>: $5 to cover film screening costs.</p>

<div>In keeping with our focus on house design in the lead up to <a href="http://sustainablehouseday.com/">Sustainable House Day</a> 2015 we will be screening a Tassie Grand Design. Cool climate builds have their own specific challenges so come along and learn from this innovative project. Independent documentary maker <a href="http://amodernbuild.com/">Alex Palmer</a> filmed the house from conception to completion and will be with us on the night to introduce the film as part of a tour that takes in Tasmania, Victoria and NSW. The house uses passive solar techniques and achieves a 9.2 Nathers Energy star rating along with a design influenced by Feng Shui practice. The house won Most Energy Efficient Build 2014 from the Tasmanian Master Builders Association.</div>

<p>Directions and further details:</p>

<p>Please arrive at 6:00pm for a 6:30pm start. The Interface head office and showroom is located within the heritage-listed <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/search/Interface+surry+hills/@-33.887304,151.202602,15z?hl=en">101 Chalmers Street building</a> in Sydney. Access from Central Station involves turning right as you leave the Devonshire St. exit, and then a short walk with a second, almost immediate right - if you get to to Prince Alfred Park you have gone too far!</p>

<p>Look for a two-storey red brick and sandstone building that adjoins a single-storey library, known as the ‘Railway Institute Building’. Entrance is at the rear of this building that has been faithfully restored and redesigned with stunning interiors, turning it into a showcase of environmental sustainability.</p>

<p>The Interface head office and showroom is just a short walk from Central Station, we encourage attendees to catch public transport to this event as nearby parking is limited.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee and tasty snacks are available before and after the talk, with gold coin donations gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>The ATA is an independent organisation that does not endorse products and seeks to provide members with information so that they can make well-informed sustainable decisions.</p>
