<p><b>Where</b>: Interface head office and showroom, 101 Chalmers St Surry Hills - next to Central Station (*PLEASE NOTE NEW VENUE*)</p>

<p><b>Topic</b>: Alternative Cities and the Circular Economy</p>

<p><b>Speaker</b>: Steven Liaros<br />

Bio: Steven Liaros is a consultant town planner at PolisPlan and author of Rethinking the City—an exploration of the ideas that underpin the organisation of cities, describing how these ideas are being transformed by the Internet.</p>

<p>With qualifications in civil engineering, town planning, building and environmental law, Steven is currently undertaking a research project at Griffith University’s Urban Research Program. This project explores how intentional communities such as eco-villages, transition towns and co-housing developments can be connected into a global network of sustainable local communities.</p>

<p>Talk summary: How do cities work? How can technology make cities as a whole operate more efficiently? What does an efficient city look like? How does the concept of the \'Circular Economy\' contribute to the creation of an energy efficient city?</p>

<p>The purpose of this presentation is to illustrate how alternative technologies fit within the city as a system. All technology operates within a system, so if the objective is environmental sustainability, we must consider the entire built environment system—the human habitat—within the larger natural system. The presentation will describe the types of technologies that are necessary for the construction of an alternative—and sustainable—city.</p>

<p>Members and non-members are asked to register by selecting ATTEND at: atasydney.eventbrite.com.au<br />

Please arrive at 6:00pm for a 6:30pm start.</p>

<p><b>The Venue:</b> The Interface head office and showroom is located within the heritage-listed 101 Chalmers Street building in Sydney. Access from Central Station involves turning left as you leave the south-eastern exit, and then short walk with a second, almost immediate left - if you get to to Prince Alfred Park you have gone too far!<br />

Look for a two-storey red brick and sandstone building that adjoins a single-storey library, known as the ‘Railway Institute Building’. Entrance is that the rear of this building that has been faithfully restored and redesigned with stunning interiors, turning it into a showcase of environmental sustainability.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee and tasty snacks are available before and after the talk, with gold coin donations gratefully accepted.<br />

The ATA is an independent organisation that does not endorse products and seeks to provide members with information so that they can make well-informed sustainable decisions.</p>
