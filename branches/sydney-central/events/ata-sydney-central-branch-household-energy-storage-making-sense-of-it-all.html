<p><strong>Presentation:</strong></p>

<p>Evan and his father Ed Darmanin have worked to make Ed’s house a working example and testing ground for renewable energy. Features include;</p>

<ul>

<li>14kW of high efficiency solar panels</li>

<li>22kWh of usable lead-acid storage</li>

<li>Three phase monitoring (SMA and SolarAnalytics)</li>

<li>BMW i3 BEV with 22kWh battery</li>

<li>ChargePoint 7.2kW home EV charger (EVSE)</li>

</ul>

<p>In researching and developing this project, Ed and Evan realised that despite their technical expertise, there was substantial complexity and misinformation in the marketplace that could lead consumers astray. This helped inspire the formation of ChargeWorks, through which Ed and Evan have been helping to educate the public ever since.<br />

Over the past 24 months Ed and Evan have been monitoring their household energy usage and optimising battery and the electric vehicle charging to suit a time-of-use tariff. This process revealed the importance of behaviour change as a way to maximise self-sufficiency as well as highlighting potential issues to our current electricity grid.<br />

This presentation will describe how their system works, their personal experience of specification and installation along with the challenges and benefits of this sort of system. There will be an analysis of household energy consumption, grid impacts and the financial performance of the system. Evan will further discuss future trends in the industry as well as the opportunities and challenges for implementing residential battery storage and electric vehicles today.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Evan Darmanin is an energy consultant specialising in solar PV, battery storage and electric vehicles. Working at <a href="http://chargeworks.com.au/">ChargeWorks</a> he has developed battery storage guides and tools in association with the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH). He regularly delivers training courses and seminars on battery storage and is able to evaluate their utility both as an engineer and economist. Evan is dedicated to understanding the latest developments in clean energy technologies and communicating the possibilities to diverse audiences. He has gained a Bachelor of Mechatronics Engineering (Hons) (Elective in Solar Thermal Energy Design) and a Bachelor of Commerce from UNSW.</p>
