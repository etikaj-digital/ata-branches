<p><strong>Where: </strong>31A Mallett Street, Camperdown (click here for a <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Pocket+City+Farms/@-33.8899266,151.1777768,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xbd794704569e8b30!8m2!3d-33.8880029!4d151.1768756">map</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Where to find us:</strong>  On arrival come and find us in the Farm area which is in NW part of the property(turn right after walking past the shipping container coffee cart and before entering the restaurant). Please BYO coffee cup and save yourself 50c.  We will be set up with a few tables and easy enough to spot among the crop swappers. From 11.30-11.50am we will be given a farm tour with Michael Zagoridis co-founder of Pocket City Farms a small group of experienced sustainability, architectural and farming folk working toward establishing urban farms.</p>

<p><strong>Outline:</strong></p>

<p>For the second time this year we are getting out and about!  Our final event of the year is on Saturday 18th November at Camperdown Commons with the crews from Pocket City Farms and the November Crop Swap.  We invite ATA members and friends to enjoy a coffee along with some tasty platters of food from the Acre Eatery.  It is a productive, green oasis adjacent to Camperdown Oval that is open to everyone and a great place for kids.</p>

<p>We will be celebrating another successful year where we have discussed everything from Prefab green homes to living roofs, kept pace with the latest development in battery technology and use of heat pumps as well as visiting Stucco and their innovative solar and battery storage system.  So what better way to end the year than to check out a new model of urban food production and see a Crop Swap in action!  It\'s a time to celebrate too as the ATA has been rewarded with a Green Globe award for <a href="http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/funding-and-support/awards-and-recognition/green-globe-awards/awards/climate-change-leadership-award" target="_blank">Climate Change Leadership from the NSW Government</a> which recognises the work of our organisation and dedicated members over 30 years in promoting and advocating for sustainability.</p>

<p>Pocket City Farms is taking to Sydney\'s neglected spaces in an effort to make good of that unused space - by producing organically-grown fresh produce for the city\'s residents!  Camperdown Commons has taken a little used bowling green and turned it into productive, arable farmland that generates fresh organic produce harvested on market day with virtually zero \'food miles\'.</p>

<p>Please make sure that you book through our Eventbrite link <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/18th-november-sydney-central-ata-at-pocket-city-farms-1030am-1200pm-tickets-39690584607" target="_blank">here</a> so that we can cater for all of our guests - just click on \'register\' on the Eventbrite page.</p>

<p>So what else is happening on the day? You are welcome to become more involved in any of the following activities that will be happening concurrently:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1382658371848578/?acontext=%7B%22action_history%22%3A%22null%22%7D" target="_blank">November Crop Swap at Pocket City Farms</a><br />

9.30-11.00am: Free<br />

Visit us at Pocket City Farms at Camperdown Commons for our monthly swap.  This one-of-a kind venue is situated in the grounds of the former bowling greens which have now been transformed into a 1200m2 market garden. These are accompanied by 180m2 of community food forest, a chicken coop, a greenhouse and a community composting program.  The vegetable and herb crops, grown using organic and ecological methods, regularly make their way onto plates at on site restaurant, Acre, and into the homes of the local community via the farm stall.  There really is no better venue or inspiration than this working ecological urban farm.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/360823754376137/" target="_blank">Grow Your Own Seedlings</a><br />

10.30-11.30am: Cost $20<br />

Great satisfaction in the garden comes from watching the full cycle of a plant, from seed to plant to produce.  Growing your own plants from seed means being assured that they\'re adapted to local conditions from day one. It\'s also the cheapest way to get your garden pumping!</p>

<p>This workshop will get you started in the art of growing your own seedlings from seed. You’ll gain first-hand experience and knowledge in seed selection, the when and how of harvesting and storing seeds, along with the growing mediums and techniques to germinate and grow your seeds.</p>

<p><strong>Public and Private Transport Options</strong><br />

Buses: There are regular services from Railway Square along Parramatta Road with buses stopping at Mallett Street<br />

Train: Newtown Station is the closest - the simplest route is to exit the station and cross to the northern side of King Street, there is a small plaza that you can walk through to join the southernmost point of Australia Street. Follow Australia Street all the way up until you reach Salisbury Road, then turn right along Salisbury and then a few blocks later, take a left turn into Mallett Street and you\'ll find Pocket City Farms just to the north of Camperdown Park.<br />

There is on-street parking but it will be in high demand!<br />

Bike: There is plenty of bike parking out the front</p>

<p>Our sincere thanks to everyone who has been involved in our branch activities in 2017. We wish you all the best for a safe, healthy, renewing and renewable New Year!</p>
