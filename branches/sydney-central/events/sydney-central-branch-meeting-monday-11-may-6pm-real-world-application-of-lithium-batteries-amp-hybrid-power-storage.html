<p>Importantly we <strong>won\'t be meeting in June</strong> but expect to see us back on 13th July with a newly energised committee and an ongoing program of high quality speakers.  We still have room for extra committee members so please talk to us on the evening if you would like to become more involved.</p>

<p>Mary Hendriks, Industry Executive of the Australian Energy Storage Alliance will provide a brief introduction to the energy storage sector in Australia before we get down to the nitty gritty of lithium batteries.</p>

<p><b>Topic:  </b>Energy Storage: Real World Application of Lithium Batteries &amp; Hybrid Power Storage</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Armin Pauza is the founder of Lithium Batteries Australia. Armin was responsible for introducing the first Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) battery to Australia and Lithium Batteries Australia has established itself as Australia’s specialised lithium battery solutions provider to government and major companies, in particular in the mining, oil and gas industries. In addition to providing solar charged lithium battery systems for off grid property owners in NSW, VIC, NT and SA, Armin recently supplied LiFePO4 solar charged batteries for the Caltex Lytton (Brisbane) oil refinery upgrade from lead acid batteries to lithium ion battery storage.Armin\'s talk will consist of a practical demonstration of various lithium batteries and cells used for off grid / hybrid power storage as well as associated chargers and battery management systems.  The talk will focus on:</p>

<ul>

<li>lithium battery chemistries and why they should or should not be used for off grid power storage based on cost, cycle life, safety considerations, etc.</li>

<li>the difference between “consumer use” and “professional grade” lithium batteries.</li>

<li>battery and cell construction so that people know why one battery type is of better quality and more likely to have a longer working life than another type of battery.</li>

<li>why lead acid batteries behave like “sheep” and why lithium batteries act like “cats”</li>

</ul>

<p>Photos of projects where lithium batteries have been supplied for remote and solar powered sites where lead acid batteries are prohibited due to hydrogen explosion risk will be used to further illustrate aspects of off grid / hybrid power storage.</p>

<p>Members and non-members are asked to register by selecting ATTEND at: <a href="http://atasydney.eventbrite.com.au">atasydney.eventbrite.com.au</a></p>

<p><strong>Directions and further details:</strong></p>

<p>Please arrive at 6:00pm for a 6:30pm start.</p>

<p><strong>Getting there:</strong> The Interface head office and showroom is located within the heritage-listed <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/search/Interface+surry+hills/@-33.887304,151.202602,15z?hl=en">101 Chalmers Street building</a> in Sydney. Access from Central Station involves turning right as you leave the Devonshire St exit, and then a short walk with a second, almost immediate right - if you get to to Prince Alfred Park you have gone too far! Look for a two-storey red brick and sandstone building that adjoins a single-storey library, known as the ‘Railway Institute Building’. Entrance is at the rear of this building that has been faithfully restored and redesigned with stunning interiors, turning it into a showcase of environmental sustainability.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee and tasty snacks are available before and after the talk, with gold coin donations gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>The ATA is an independent organisation that does not endorse products and seeks to provide members with information so that they can make well-informed sustainable decisions.</p>
