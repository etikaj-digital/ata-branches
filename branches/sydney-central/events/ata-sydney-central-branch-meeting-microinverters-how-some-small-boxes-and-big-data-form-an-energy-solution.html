<p>The rise of microinverters seems to follow the possibilities afforded by Moore\'s Law but what happens when small meets big? This is a great opportunity to learn more about the potential of microinverters as well as getting a sneak preview of the Enphase energy storage platform that will be released later this year.</p>

<p><b>Speaker</b><strong>:</strong> Keera Single studied Photovoltaic Engineering, Japanese, and International Business at both UNSW, and Tohoku University, Japan. Starting at Conergy in 2006, Keera oversaw PV product management, logistics, and engineering services as Technical Services Manager and held a seat on the Clean Energy Council PV Directorate. After 4 years with Conergy, Keera began consulting for Global Sustainable Energy Solutions in 2010, where he was responsible for training electricians in the CEC Accreditation course. Keera joined Q-Cells in late 2010 as Business Development Manager, bringing his technical knowledge and sales skills, and experience in working with Australian solar companies, before moving to Enphase in 2014 as Strategic Account Manager where he is the first point of contact for major account partners in NSW, ACT, and WA.</p>

<p><strong>Directions and further details:</strong></p>

<p>Please arrive at 6:00pm for a 6:30pm start.</p>

<p><strong>Getting there:</strong> The Interface head office and showroom is located within the heritage-listed <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/search/Interface+surry+hills/@-33.887304,151.202602,15z?hl=en">101 Chalmers Street building</a> in Sydney. Access from Central Station involves turning right as you leave the Devonshire St exit, and then a short walk with a second, almost immediate right - if you get to to Prince Alfred Park you have gone too far! Look for a two-storey red brick and sandstone building that adjoins a single-storey library, known as the ‘Railway Institute Building’. Entrance is at the rear of this building that has been faithfully restored and redesigned with stunning interiors, turning it into a showcase of environmental sustainability.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee and tasty snacks are available before and after the talk, with gold coin donations gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>The ATA is an independent organisation that does not endorse products and seeks to provide members with information so that they can make well-informed sustainable decisions.</p>
