        <p><strong>When</strong>: Tuesday 10 June, 6:00pm for 6:30pm<br />

<strong>Where</strong>: Wallaby Room, 11th Floor, Telstra Building, 320 Pitt St Sydney</p>

<p><strong>Speakers</strong>: Phil &amp; Trish Chapallaz - Co-Founders and Directors of <a href="https://solar4rvs.com.au/home.html" target="_blank">Solar 4 RV</a>s</p>

<p>Phil is a Marine Engineer and Chartered Engineer with First Class Honours in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. His passion for problem solving and thinking outside the box has led to innovative solutions in a range of defence and commercial projects including unmanned aerial vehicles, exercise mines and communications systems. In 2009 Phil worked on the Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) Project as Integration Manager to upgrade the Royal Australian Navy\'s amphibious fleet on what are the largest vessels ever operated by the Navy. At the end of 2012, after 26 years with BAE Systems, Phil retired to pursue other interests.</p>

<p>Trish was formerly a Director of Learning for the School for Sustainable Futures at Swinburne University and brings her skills in marketing, business innovation, and business systems design to the company. After purchasing a 21ft caravan they set out to install a solar power system so they could be nomads free from dependence on mains power. They were unable to find quality products bundled together with good suitability for RVs. After eight months of research and testing the Melbourne-based, national business now provides a range of quality, robust, lightweight products and customised, integrated solar power kits for recreational vehicles such as caravans, motorhomes, camper trailers, and boats. They specify the latest technology thin, flexible monocrystalline PV panels and lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries as well as developing solar power engineering solutions for RV manufacturers.</p>

<div><b>Talk summary:</b></div>

<div>This talk will focus on small-scale solar power systems for mobile and other applications; how they integrate and what are the advantages and disadvantages of different systems. It will be a thorough introduction into how systems work as well as a primer for people who want to design or specify for their own system. The following points will be covered:</div>

<div>1. Quick overview of the basic components:</div>

<ul>

<li>Requirements including certification</li>

<li>Monocrystalline PV solar panels (flexible and portable)</li>

<li>MPPT Solar charge controllers/regulators</li>

<li>LiFePO4 batteries</li>

<li>Battery monitoring, protection and management</li>

<li>Inverters.</li>

</ul>

<div>2. Considerations when designing a small scale system:</div>

<ul>

<li>Calculating system requirements</li>

<li>Maximising access to solar irradiation</li>

<li>Advantages and disadvantages of various options</li>

<li>Capacity v capability – designing with realistic expectations</li>

<li>Pitfalls.</li>

</ul>

<div>3. Installation requirements and considerations<br />

4. Case studies – what has worked well and what hasn’t!<br />

5. The future – where to from here?</div>
