<p><strong>Presenter: </strong> Tracy Graham is the director of Connected Design, consulting for individuals and organisations who want buildings that work well, feel good and reduce their ecological footprint. Tracy enjoys bringing together client, design process, engineering and builder to deliver beautiful, comfortable and efficient results. Tracy was honoured with the National Building Designers Australia Award in 2015 for the Green Living Centre in Newtown and Commended for the Marrickville Hempcrete House in 2016.</p>

<p><strong>What Makes a Sustainable Home?</strong></p>

<p>The Marrickville Hempcrete house is an exciting project that shows how acoustic requirements for aircraft noise can be met without compromising on thermal performance and aesthetics. The Design challenge was to create a better living space for a family of four without increasing the site coverage. The existing footprint has not been increased on the ground floor but reconfigured to improve circulation, usability and connection to the backyard. A mere 35 square meters has been added on the first floor. The result is a generous house that provides three bedrooms, a study, two bathrooms, laundry, generous kitchen dining area and outdoor space on a 197.5sqm site. This is a renovation that incorporates basic passive design principles combined for clients who weren\'t afraid to be bold with new materials, texture and colour.</p>

<p>The talk will cover the journey on finding the best design solution when renovating a semi-detached house, including overcoming challenges with a first floor addition with a shared party wall and acoustic requirements. It will also discuss why the decision was made to use Hempcrete in the project and the importance of a dedicated group of consultants, suppliers and an ambitious builder working collaboratively throughout the process.</p>

<p><strong>Directions and further details</strong>:</p>

<p>Please arrive at 6:00pm for a 6:30pm start.</p>

<p>The Interface head office and showroom is located within the heritage-listed <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/search/Interface+surry+hills/@-33.887304,151.202602,15z?hl=en">101 Chalmers Street building</a> in Sydney.  Access from Central Station involves turning right as you leave the Devonshire St exit, and then a short walk with a second, almost immediate right - if you get to to Prince Alfred Park you have gone too far!</p>

<p>Look for a two-storey red brick and sandstone building that adjoins a single-storey library, known as the ‘Railway Institute Building’. Entrance is at the rear of this building that has been faithfully restored and redesigned with stunning interiors, turning it into a showcase of environmental sustainability.  Due to our proximity to Central Station, we encourage attendees to catch public transport to this event as nearby parking is limited.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee and tasty snacks are available before and after the talk, with donations gratefully accepted.</p>
