<p><b>Auatralian Solar Council Sydney Chapter</b> would like to invite ATA members and friends to their information eveningsheld on the fourth Tuesday of every month.For details go to their website <a href="http://solar.org.au/chapters/sydney-central-chapter/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Members and non-members are asked to register by selecting ATTEND at: <a href="http://atasydney.eventbrite.com.au/">atasydney.eventbrite.com.au</a></p>

<p><strong>Directions and further details</strong>:</p>

<p>Please arrive at 6:00pm for a 6:30pm start.</p>

<p>The Interface head office and showroom is located within the heritage-listed <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/search/Interface+surry+hills/@-33.887304,151.202602,15z?hl=en">101 Chalmers Street building</a> in Sydney.  Access from Central Station involves turning right as you leave the Devonshire St exit, and then a short walk with a second, almost immediate right - if you get to to Prince Alfred Park you have gone too far!</p>

<p>Look for a two-storey red brick and sandstone building that adjoins a single-storey library, known as the ‘Railway Institute Building’. Entrance is at the rear of this building that has been faithfully restored and redesigned with stunning interiors, turning it into a showcase of environmental sustainability.  Due to our proximity to Central Station, we encourage attendees to catch public transport to this event as nearby parking is limited.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee and tasty snacks are available before and after the talk, with donations gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>The ATA is an independent organisation that does not endorse products and seeks to provide members with information so that they can make well-informed sustainable decisions.</p>

<p>Thanks for your ongoing support of the ATA Sydney Central Branch.</p>
