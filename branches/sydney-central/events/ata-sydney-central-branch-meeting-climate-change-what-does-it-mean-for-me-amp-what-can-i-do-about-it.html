<strong>Cost</strong>: As we have paid an NGO rate for the EnergyLab space, a $5 minimum donation would be appreciated with the possibility of raising extra funds to support the work of the Climate Council.</p>

<p>This month we are providing unfiltered access to the independent science offered by the <a href="https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/">Climate Council</a>. Locally 98% of NSW and over 60% of Queensland farmland is in drought with a <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso/">probable El Nino on the horizon</a>.  Our dry winter has been matched by a change in weather patterns in in the Northern hemisphere with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44941999">wildfires in the US, Greece and Sweden</a>.</p>

<p>As we move from the Holocene deeper into the Anthropocene it is becoming apparent that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/31/climate-change-denial-oil-companies-fossil-fuels">climate change denial is in fact a zero-sum game even for oil companies</a>.  The extremes of climate change events and their violence challenge us to rethink our way of life. It is within communities such as that of the ATA that we can take steps to avert the worst of the climate crisis.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation:</strong></p>

<p>Annika will be presenting on the impacts of climate change in Australia, as well as the causes and solutions. The focus of the talk is on practical actions that everyday Australians can take to advance the national conversation on climate change and contribute towards deeply and rapidly reducing Australia’s greenhouse gas pollution levels over the coming years.<br />

The talk will also provide an overview of some of the activities of the Climate Council, including our flagship Cities Power Partnerships Program - the largest climate program for Local Government in Australia.</p>

<p><strong>Bio</strong>: Annika Dean works as a Senior Researcher at the Climate Council of Australia. She has a PhD from the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, and was previously a lecturer on climate change and energy policy at the University of New South Wales.</p>
