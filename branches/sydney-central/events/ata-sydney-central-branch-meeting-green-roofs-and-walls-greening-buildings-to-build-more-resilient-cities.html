<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Lucy Sharman has worked in sustainability across the private, not-for-profit and government sectors and is currently currently working in Sustainability and Tenant Engagement for Lendlease.  Her roles have covered environmental management systems, policy development and strategic planning as well as stakeholder education and engagement.  At the City of Sydney Council Lucy developed the <a href="http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/vision/towards-2030/sustainability/greening-the-city/green-roofs-and-walls#page-element-dload">City’s Green Roofs and Walls Policy and developed guides and supporting documentation</a> to improve the implementation of green roofs and walls in Sydney.</p>

<p><b>Talk summary:</b>  Expect to leave with a whole new appreciation of the possibilities of green roofs and walls.  The talk will focus on:</p>

<ul>

<li>Defining green roofs and walls – what are they are and what are the different types</li>

<li>What is their history globally and in Australia</li>

<li>What are the benefits of green roofs and walls to buildings as well as to the broader environment</li>

<li>Design guidance – the pitfalls and priorities for good design</li>

<li>Resources and assistance – where to find more information.</li>

</ul>

<p>Members and non-members are asked to register by selecting ATTEND at: <a href="http://atasydney.eventbrite.com.au">atasydney.eventbrite.com.au</a></p>

<p><strong>Directions and further details</strong>:</p>

<p>Please arrive at 6:00pm for a 6:30pm start.</p>

<p>The Interface head office and showroom is located within the heritage-listed <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/search/Interface+surry+hills/@-33.887304,151.202602,15z?hl=en">101 Chalmers Street building</a> in Sydney.  Access from Central Station involves turning right as you leave the Devonshire St exit, and then a short walk with a second, almost immediate right - if you get to to Prince Alfred Park you have gone too far!</p>

<p>Look for a two-storey red brick and sandstone building that adjoins a single-storey library, known as the ‘Railway Institute Building’. Entrance is at the rear of this building that has been faithfully restored and redesigned with stunning interiors, turning it into a showcase of environmental sustainability.  Due to our proximity to Central Station, we encourage attendees to catch public transport to this event as nearby parking is limited.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee and tasty snacks are available before and after the talk, with donations gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>The ATA is an independent organisation that does not endorse products and seeks to provide members with information so that they can make well-informed sustainable decisions.</p>
