<p><strong>Speaker 1 - Greg Partridge, AEVA National President.</strong><br />

Talk - Electric Vehicles – a (long-term) owner’s perspective.<br />

We are hearing more and more about Electric Vehicles, the pros and the cons, the challenges and opportunities, but what is really like to own an electric vehicle in Australia? What if that EV was your only vehicle? Greg Partridge is a long-term EV owner and driver and will share his in-depth knowledge on this topic.</p>

<p><strong>Bio</strong>: Greg Partridge has been involved in the Australian Electric Vehicle Association (<a href="http://www.aeva.asn.au/">AEVA</a>) since 2009. He is currently the National President, National media officer and NSW Branch Chairman of AEVA. Greg is passionate about improving charging infrastructure, something that he feels has been an obstacle to electric vehicle adoption in Australia.</p>

<p>Greg was an AEVA representative in the 2017 “Round Australian Charging Route” aimed at installing charging outlets every 400 kms around Australia. He was also a participant in the first electric vehicle to drive to Darwin from Sydney in an electric vehicle, unassisted. Greg currently drives an electric Nissan LEAF and a Mitsubishi iMiEV. Professionally, he works as a Registered Nurse in the NSW health system.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker 2 - Dean Economou, CTO, Products at Telstra</strong><br />

Talk – Future Transport<br />

The global transport sector is being disrupted by an exciting combination of technology, market and societal forces. Dean Economou will explore with us the forces at play; connectedness, electrification, self-driving technology, shared mobility and new vehicle categories like drones, electric VTOL and eBikes, giving us a view on the future of transport.</p>

<p><strong>Bio</strong>: Dean\'s career has been at the centre of digital disruption across sectors as diverse as telecommunications, media, health and transport.</p>

<p>Beginning as an engineer he co-founded telecommunications vendor QPSX, directed the CSIRO Lab which earlier created fast Wi-Fi, and was Director Infrastructure, Transport and Logistics at National ICT Australia. He joined Telstra as Chief Technology Officer for Products, working across many business units within Telstra with a special interest in future transport technologies.</p>
