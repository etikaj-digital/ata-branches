<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Architect and builder Stephen Sainsbury specialises in environmentally and ecologically sound beautiful places to shelter, undertaking the building process in the belief that environmentally aware buildings can be luxurious, inspiring and beautiful places to live work and play. The practice aim is to achieve the highest possible aesthetic return for the lowest achievable ecological impact. If in the making of buildings we can lessen the consumption of resources, this not only reduces humanity\'s detrimental impact, but can also inspire responsibility in other areas. Ecologically sensitive buildings are coming to symbolise a more mature, environmentally aware culture.</p>

<p><strong>Talk summary: “Perils, Pitfalls and Perseverance in Prefab - ‘Epic Fails\'”</strong></p>

<p>Factory-constructed prefabricated modular building is an evolutionary direction for construction into the future. Modular systems use mass repetition of parts fabrication for cost-effective production and are an established way of producing cost and time-controlled architect-designed buildings. This talk focuses on Stephen\'s 30 years of experience in building prefabricated constructions in workshops and taking them to site which will add a little gritty reality to the theories and ideas.</p>

<p>How prefab can fail...<br />

1. Dimensioning - ‘Harry 100’ and other issues.<br />

2. Labelling - North South East West WHICH WAY IS NORTH.? - A B C D - 1 2 3 4 - i ii iii iv - orientation and ‘fool-proofing’ – how do you set up a labelling system that is foolproof and understandable by every one who needs to understand it.<br />

3. Logistics - Getting everything there without leaving anything behind - and proving it was in the box and arrived on site.<br />

4. Murphy’s Law - ‘if anything can possibly go wrong it will’ &amp; Mackenzie\'s Corollary – ‘in the worst possible way’, Ecoshelta Appendix - ‘at the most unexpected time and place’</p>

<p>In short, it\'s essential to \'design\' the production and assembly processes, not just the object. To get you primed on the topic please read the modular special from <a href="http://www.sanctuarymagazine.org.au/ideas-advice/focus/twelve-of-the-best-modular-and-prefab-creations/">Sanctuary 31</a>.</p>

<p>Members and non-members are asked to register by selecting ATTEND at: <a href="http://atasydney.eventbrite.com.au">atasydney.eventbrite.com.au</a></p>

<p>After the presentation, Sydney Central ATA will have its AGM and election of officers. This will be open only to members of the ATA. We are always keen to get members more involved in the local group and so please feel free to stay and take part.</p>

<p><strong>Directions and further details</strong>:</p>

<p>Please arrive at 6:00pm for a 6:30pm start.</p>

<p>The Interface head office and showroom is located within the heritage-listed <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/search/Interface+surry+hills/@-33.887304,151.202602,15z?hl=en">101 Chalmers Street building</a> in Sydney.  Access from Central Station involves turning right as you leave the Devonshire St exit, and then a short walk with a second, almost immediate right - if you get to to Prince Alfred Park you have gone too far!</p>

<p>Look for a two-storey red brick and sandstone building that adjoins a single-storey library, known as the ‘Railway Institute Building’. Entrance is at the rear of this building that has been faithfully restored and redesigned with stunning interiors, turning it into a showcase of environmental sustainability.  Due to our proximity to Central Station, we encourage attendees to catch public transport to this event as nearby parking is limited.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee and tasty snacks are available before and after the talk, with donations gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>The ATA is an independent organisation that does not endorse products and seeks to provide members with information so that they can make well-informed sustainable decisions.</p>
