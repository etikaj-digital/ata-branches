<p>The ATA Sydney branch have teamed up with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GreenUps" target="_blank">GreenUps</a> to present this great event on Communty Energy (along with <a href="http://www.ethinvest.com.au" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ethinvest</a>, <a href="http://c4ce.net.au" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">C4CE</a> and <a href="http://cpagency.org.au" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Community Power Agency</a>).</p>

<div><b>For the November Greenups, we’ve invited a range of Community Energy organisations to come and share their ideas and projects, all to to inspire, inform and allow you to get on board.</b></div>

<div>With 87 per cent of Australians supporting renewable energy from rooftop solar, and a solar system sold every three minutes, it comes as no surprise that community groups across the country are increasingly taking matters into their own hands and pursuing local, community-owned energy projects.</div>

<div>These community-led projects allow local groups to take control of their own energy future, reduce their carbon footprint, and reinvest their energy bill savings back into the community for its social needs.</div>

<div>Come along to hear first hand from the these groups, what they\'ve achieved, what they have planned, and how you can get involved.</div>

<div><b>Participating Community Projects:</b></div>

<div>Meet the community guided tours from <span class="">5pm</span>.</div>
