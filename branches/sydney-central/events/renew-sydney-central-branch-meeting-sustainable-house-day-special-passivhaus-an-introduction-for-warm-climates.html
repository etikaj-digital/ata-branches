<p><strong>Presentation:</strong></p>

<p>Andy Marlow is an architect and Certified Passive House Designer. He is a director of <a href="http://www.envirotecture.com.au/">Envirotecture</a> and a volunteer Board member of the <a href="https://passivehouseaustralia.org/">Australian Passive House Association</a>. Andy is driven by a desire for all people to live, work and play in buildings that make them happier. He believes that good design should be accessible to and benefit all, not just those who commission it.</p>

<p>He has led master planning projects, been involved in several successful competitions including the <a href="https://www.bathurst.nsw.gov.au/sustainablehouse.html">Bathurst Sustainable Lifestyle House</a>, and led the materials research for Australia’s first (almost) certified Living Building under the arduous Living Building Challenge – the <a href="https://sbrc.uow.edu.au/sbrcbuilding/index.html">Sustainable Buildings Research Centre</a> at the University of Wollongong.</p>

<p>The evening will present the key fundamentals of Passivhaus including where and when it is an appropriate design strategy. The technical parameters will be explored and some of the possible design solutions will be presented and discussed.</p>

<p>A Passive House retrofit project (EnerPHit) will be used to demonstrate how the Passive House Planning Package can be cost-effectively utilised to optimise design solutions and highlight the biggest challenges in a Sydney climate.</p>
