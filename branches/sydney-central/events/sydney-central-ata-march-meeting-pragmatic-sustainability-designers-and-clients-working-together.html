<div><b><strong>Pragmatic Sustainability: designers and clients working together</strong></b></div>

<div><b>Speaker</b>: Darryn Parkinson - Design and Construction Director: <a href="http://www.yourabode.com.au" target="_blank">yourabode</a></div>

<div>

<p>With over 25 years experience in design and construction, Darryn believes that to create a truly green, sustainable building, the design and construction should be integrated as one. With both disciplines working together, Darryn prioritises project management, sustainability and relationships to create homes of outstanding quality and environmental credentials.  Darryn recognises that open communication, design knowledge and construction experience are the key to pragmatic sustainability.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:  This talk will focus on the practicalities of designing and building sustainable homes.  Darryn will present three case studies of projects he has recently completed.  Through these case studies he will look at:</p>

<ul>

<li>Where should you begin when it all seems so daunting?</li>

<li>As a client, how does one work successfully with your designer, builder or contractors in order to achieve  the outcomes you are seeking.</li>

<li>The importance of your design and construction team working together and all “rowing in the same direction”.</li>

<li>Finding your “green line”, how green do you really want your project to be?</li>

<li>Where to compromise and prioritise, as the reality is that you probably won’t be able to have it all.</li>

<li>How far will your budget stretch?</li>

</ul>
