<p>Does LED lighting live up to the hype? Join us for this month\'s talk to find out whether LED lighting lives up to its claims and what you should be looking for when replacing your lighting.</p>

<p><b>Speaker:</b> David Wren runs the web site <a href="http://www.ledbenchmark.com"><span style="color: #021eaa">www.ledbenchmark.com</span></a>. He has spent the last three years testing residential LED lighting. After studying science at UNSW, he worked for 10 years in Europe and Australia as part of the engineering team that designed and installed the first digital mobile phone networks. Approximately 15 years ago he set up his own company, PassMark Software Pty Ltd, with the aim of developing software and custom electronics to measure the performance of computer components.<br />

Frustrated with the lack of technical reviews on LED lighting, plus the false information being disseminated by some vendors, he developed test equipment and a methodology for objectively comparing the performance of LED lighting in a scientific manner. To date David has reviewed 300 different models of LED lights and made the results publically available.</p>

<p><b>Talk summary:</b> David joins us to share the results of his LED lighting testing and provides some insight into the future of LED lighting. The talk will cover:</p>

<ul>

<li>What are LED lights and what makes them good</li>

<li>Why LED lighting still isn’t prefect</li>

<li>How we measure a LED’s performance?</li>

<li>Do LED lights live up to the vendor’s claims?</li>

<li>What to look for when buying a LED light</li>

<li>What the future looks like for LED lighting</li>

</ul>
