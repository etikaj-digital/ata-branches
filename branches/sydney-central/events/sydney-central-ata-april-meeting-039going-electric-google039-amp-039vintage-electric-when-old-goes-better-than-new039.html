<div>Thanks to all who made it to the March event and for the robust discussion around the importance of more sustainably-thinking practitioners in the construction industry. In April we are looking at electric cars from two very different perspectives: from how they\'ve been integrated for use within a corporation to enable collaborative use and from a maverick leader operating outside of the norm who is going to be turning heads with his electric Citroen DS. Electric cars are coming and these two unique speakers will explain some of the many ways that they will arrive on our streets.</div>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: <strong>Going Electric @ Google</strong> by Sam Thorogood</p>

<p>Sam Thorogood is a senior software engineer at Google Australia, and in his "20% time" works on small projects, all with a sustainability angle. One of these projects is a car share scheme, called GoCred, that rewards Googlers for walking or otherwise commuting sustainably to the Sydney office with the use of two electric vehicles. These cars may be used for work errands, but also be taken home overnight or on weekends.<br />

To learn more about the project: <a href="http://google-au.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/trip-report-green-cars.html" target="_blank">http://google-au.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/trip-report-green-cars.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: <strong>Vintage Electric when Old Goes Better than New</strong> by Aldo Grech<br />

Aldo Grech works to help people discover their leadership qualities through his skills as a mentor and leader. He is particularly passionate about Citroens and the lines of the classic DS model are those of a sculpture in motion. Retrofitting a vintage car to become electric comes with challenges but the rewards are more than worth it. This is an opportunity to learn about the process and see what is being achieved today in a vintage electric car, when old becomes better than new. Check out the progress so far on this awesome project: <a href="http://amanoauto.blogspot.com.au/" target="_blank">http://amanoauto.blogspot.com.au/</a></p>
