<p><strong>Where: </strong>Interface head office and showroom, 101 Chalmers St, Surry Hills (click here for a <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/search/Interface+surry+hills/@-33.887304,151.202602,15z?hl=en">map</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Speakers:</strong> The team from <a href="http://www.pingala.org.au/">Pingala</a> – Community Renewables for Sydney</p>

<p><strong>Talk summary:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pingala</strong> is creating a model for community energy starting with the setting up of a community solar farm on the roof of the Young Henry’s brewery in Newtown.</p>

<p>You will hear about the <strong>Pingala</strong> story - starting with an idea shared between two people three and a half years ago, right through to last week becoming Australia\'s first operating community solar co-operative and joining a select group of investment driven community energy models up and running in Australia right now.</p>

<p>Also hear about how what Pingala provides differs from solar leasing and PPA products already out there in the market - how we unlock the power of communities to deliver so much more than just clean energy by using solar to activate the key stakeholders that matter most to our customers.</p>

<p>Finally, the team will talk about our ambitious plans to become a large community energy group servicing the Sydney community by delivering clean energy in a way which is fairer for everyone.</p>

<p>Members and non-members are asked to register by selecting ATTEND at: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/pingala-a-fairer-energy-system-for-sydney-tickets-27429177408">Eventbrite</a></p>

<p><strong>Directions and further details</strong>:</p>

<p>Please arrive at 6:00pm for a 6:30pm start.</p>

<p>The Interface head office and showroom is located within the heritage-listed <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/search/Interface+surry+hills/@-33.887304,151.202602,15z?hl=en">101 Chalmers Street building</a> in Sydney.  Access from Central Station involves turning right as you leave the Devonshire St exit, and then a short walk with a second, almost immediate right - if you get to to Prince Alfred Park you have gone too far!</p>

<p>Look for a two-storey red brick and sandstone building that adjoins a single-storey library, known as the ‘Railway Institute Building’. Entrance is at the rear of this building that has been faithfully restored and redesigned with stunning interiors, turning it into a showcase of environmental sustainability.  Due to our proximity to Central Station, we encourage attendees to catch public transport to this event as nearby parking is limited.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee and tasty snacks are available before and after the talk, with donations gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>The ATA is an independent organisation that does not endorse products and seeks to provide members with information so that they can make well-informed sustainable decisions.</p>
