<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Chris Howe is the director of Howe Architects with offices in Sydney and Auckland and co-convenor of the ATA’s Sydney Central Branch.  Known for a number of exemplary sustainable homes on Sydney Harbour and coastal projects in New Zealand, Chris has been involved in a wide range of architectural projects both as an architect and builder.  He has particular interest and expertise in thermally efficient building envelopes and the NZ leaking building syndrome.  Working as an educator he has been a keynote speaker at design &amp; industry conferences on the built environment and has presented papers and case studies on environmentally sustainable design in Australia, New Zealand and the USA.</p>

<p><strong>Talk summary:</strong><br />

This talk will focus on thermally efficient building envelopes versus condensation and how to specify insulation to ensure the optimal solution.  Most people know that insulated walls, floors or ceilings can significantly reduce heat gain or loss and therefore the amount of energy used in our homes.  What is little known is the increase in the incidence of condensation causing damage, loss and deterioration in buildings and also the health of occupants resulting from changes in materials, practices and insulation products that have and continue to transform the residential building industry.</p>

<p>The presence of condensation, particularly within the concealed voids of buildings gives rise to infestations of fungus and mould which have the potential to be injurious to the health of occupiers which can significantly accelerate the deterioration of building materials including structural components.</p>

<p>This presentation will provide an understanding of the role of insulation in the control of heat gain/loss, what to take into consideration to minimise the risk of condensation in both new and existing buildings, the importance of controlling air flow through the building envelope and what to look for when specifying and installing building insulation.</p>
