<p><strong>Presentation</strong>:</p>

<p>Australian Industry has a huge demand for heat which is required to manufacture most industrial materials such as metals, plastics, rubber, cement, glass, food, drink and ceramics. Burning coal and natural gas to generate this heat causes about 8% of national greenhouse emissions. There are no government policies or industry plans to make significant reductions in these emissions.</p>

<p>This presentation will show how Australia can use its abundant potential to produce renewable electricity to generate heat for industry. The talk will include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Explanation of electrical heating technologies including industrial heat pumps, microwaves, infrared, induction and how they can service almost any industrial heat process.</li>

<li>How manufacturers can secure 100% renewable electricity through a PPA.</li>

<li>Australia’s global advantage in powering energy-intensive industries with renewable energy.</li>

<li>The advantages of electrically-driven heating including efficiency, control and flexibility.</li>

</ul>

<p>The presentation is a summary of Beyond Zero Emissions’ latest report, Electrifying Industry published in<br />

September 2018.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker</strong>:</p>

<p>Michael Lord is Beyond Zero Emissions\' Head of Research. He is leading research into a zero-carbon industry plan for Australia. He has recently completed Electrifying Industry, a report showing the potential for renewable electricity to replace fossil fuels in industrial heat processes. He was also lead author of Rethinking Cement – the world’s first report to show how to eliminate emissions from the cement sector.<br />

Michael joined Beyond Zero Emissions from an environmental consultancy, where he advised local governments and the private sector on reducing emissions and managing climate risk.</p>

<p>Before that Michael was the infrastructure lead on the UK Government\'s Climate Ready program, working with energy and transport operators to improve their climate resilience. Michael also worked in the Climate Change team at the Victorian Government.</p>

<p>* We recognise and appreciate the assistance of the University of Melbourne <a href="http://energy-transition-hub.org/">Energy Transition Hub</a> in providing the venue for this event.</p>

<p>We hope to see you on the evening.</p>

<p>Regards,<br />

Chris Moss, Renew Melbourne branch committee.<br />
