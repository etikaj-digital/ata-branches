<p>Craig Memery, the ATA\'s energy policy advocate, will discuss What Happens When We Unplug, the recent groundbreaking report by the ATA and Energy for the People that found regional communities and new housing estates could function viably off the electricity grid.</p>

<p>Solar and battery storage technology is changing rapidly. The report reached the exciting conclusion that by 2020 cost would no longer be a barrier to individuals and communities generating and storing their own power.</p>

<p>A lively Q&amp;A session is anticipated!<br />

Craig works for the ATA, where his role is divided between<br />

- providing advice on sustainable energy to communities, government and the private sector, and<br />

- advocating, on behalf of consumers and communities, for reforms in the National Energy Market that bring about improved regulation and market efficiency.</p>

<p>You can read the ATA report "What Happens When We Un-Plug? Exploring the consumer and market implications of viable, off-grid energy supply" <a href="http://www.ata.org.au/ata-research/towns-and-estates-could-unplug-from-the-grid-report" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
