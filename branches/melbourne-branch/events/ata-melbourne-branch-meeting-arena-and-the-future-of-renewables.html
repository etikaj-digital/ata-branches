<p><strong>Presentation: The status of renewable energy and ARENA\'s significant and<br />

innovative role in its future</strong></p>

<p>We are fortunate to be able to welcome Phil Cohn to our June meeting. Phil is going to speak to us about the current state of the renewable energy market, and the innovative role ARENA plays in this changing environment. His presentation will cover ARENA\'s new investment priorities, how ARENA provides funding to support commercialisation of new renewable energy technologies and businesses, and provide some case studies of projects and programs that ARENA has supported. Definitely a meeting not to be missed!</p>

<p>Phil works in the Business Development and Transactions team at ARENA. As well as assessing projects for their suitability for grant funding and ensuring that they are delivered effectively, Phil has led the development and implementation of A-Lab, ARENA’s grid integration innovation lab, which draws on a network of people with a wide range of expertise to drive systemic change in the energy sector.</p>

<p>Prior to ARENA, Phil was a founding partner of RAMP Carbon, an enterprise that worked with organisations to design and implement projects in the areas of renewable energy, water and energy efficiency, waste management and biodiversity preservation. Before RAMP, he was the head of Clean Development Mechanism projects at Cool nrg International, leading the team there in the development of residential energy efficiency and carbon trading projects in developing countries, with a particular focus on Mexico.</p>

<p>Please feel free to invite friends and colleagues; our meetings are open to members and guests. We look forward to seeing you there.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Peter Wonfor, Melbourne branch committee.</p>
