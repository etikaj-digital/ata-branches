<p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Michael Lord, Beyond Zero Emissions</p>

<p>Cement-making is currently responsible for 8% of global emissions, and this proportion is set to rise significantly by 2050. Cement-related emissions are often cited as being too difficult to tackle.<br />

Beyond Zero Emissions’ research describes a pathway for Australia to reduce cement-related emissions to zero in just 10 years. Australia is well-positioned to lead on zero carbon cement strategies, and then sell these technologies to the rest of the world.<br />

Michael Lord is BZE\'s Head of Research. He is leading research into a zero carbon industry plan for Australia, and was lead author of the Rethinking Cement report.<br />

Michael joined BZE from an environmental consultancy, where he advised local governments and the private sector on reducing emissions and managing climate risk.<br />

Before that Michael was the infrastructure lead on the UK Government\'s Climate Ready program, working with energy and transport operators to improve their climate resilience. Michael has also worked in the Climate Change team at the Victorian Government.</p>
