<p><strong>Presenter: Lindsay Hart - Sales Manager Australia/New Zealand, Selectronic Australia</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Apart from a 6 year stint heading up the inverter division for Solar Energy Australia, Lindsay Hart has been with Selectronic for his entire career since starting with the company in 1978 as an apprentice electronics tradesman. He has helped develop and successfully launch almost 100 different inverter models since 1981. Technical sales presentations and Training is the area that Lindsay most enjoys; trying to ensure that system design and installation is always of the highest quality. A lifetime in the inverter business, Lindsay has been living Off Grid since 1994 and is proud of his lifelong achievements so far in the industry and excited about what lies ahead. Lindsay and Selectronic are names synonymous with storage systems, both hybrid (grid-connected) and off-grid.  Selectronic has been supplying systems domestically and internationally for many years and has a well-respected product line and reputation.<br />

<strong>Presentation:</strong> Lindsay will explain the \'hows and whys\' of storage, the benefits it offers to different individual situations and how including storage in a domestic or small business environment changes the "centre of gravity" of a conventional grid-connected PV system from the PV system inverter to the storage system\'s battery management system and associated equipment.</p>

<p>We will come away more aware of what we as the users need to know in order to work with a system designer/provider to ensure an optimum system <i>for our individual situation</i> is specified.  No one-size-fits-all exists!!</p>

<p>Our sincere thanks to Lindsay for bringing forward his presentation at short notice.<br />

Be ready with your questions for the Q&amp;A session.</p>

<p>Regards, Robin and the Melbourne branch committee.<br />
