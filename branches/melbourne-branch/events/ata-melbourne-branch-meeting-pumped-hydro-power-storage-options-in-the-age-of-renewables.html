<p><strong>Presenter</strong>:   Roger Dargaville, Senior Lecturer in Renewables, Monash University</p>

<p>After years of falling demand for electricity in the NEM, and a resulting oversupply of generation and depressed wholesale prices, the system is going through a major transformation as the penetration of non-dispatchable renewables increases. Most importantly, there has been a significant retirement of coal fired generators, totalling over 4GW, most notably 1.6GW with the withdrawal of Hazelwood. Based on life expectancy of the current stock, we would expect a further 12GW of coal generation to be retired by 2032, just 15 years away. Given that it is very unlikely that any new coal fired generators will be built, and that gas is currently at record prices, storage is looking like being a serious contender to keep the system operating securely.</p>

<p>But what kind of storage? Lithium Ion is all the rage, but 99% of the global electricity system storage is Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES). What are the options for PHES in Australia? In this presentation we will look at 2 different styles - large-scale (~200MW) PHES with seawater, using case studies for the Energy Australia Cultana (S. Aus) feasibility study, and small scale freshwater PHES (~5MW),and the Euroa Seymour Energy Alliance pre-feasibility study. We will also look briefly at the GENEX/Kidson and Snowy 2.0 projects.</p>

<p>We will do a comparison between Lithium Ion and PHES, and discuss what each of the storage technologies can and can’t do, including bulk storage, FCAS, inertia and blackstart. Finally, if time allows I will present a radical new energy storage technology known as liquid air energy storage.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Dr Roger Dargaville is the Senior Lecturer in Renewable Energy at Monash University. He is an expert in energy systems and climate change. Roger specialises in large-scale energy system transition optimisation, and novel energy storage technologies such as seawater pumped hydro and liquid air energy storage.<br />

Roger leads a research group of PhD and Masters students working on a diverse range of energy related topics. He teaches undergraduate subjects on renewable energy technologies at Monash University and previously taught Masters level subjects at Melbourne University.<br />

Roger completed his undergraduate and PhD at the University of Melbourne. He has worked at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (USA) and at the Centre nationale de la recherche scientifique (CNRS, France), the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission at UNESCO, the International Energy Agency, and most recently was the Deputy Director at the Melbourne Energy Institute at the University of Melbourne.</p>

<p>We hope to see you at the meeting.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Chris Moss, Melbourne branch committee.</p>
