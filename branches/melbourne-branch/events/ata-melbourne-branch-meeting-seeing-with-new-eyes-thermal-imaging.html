<p>Convenor: Chris Moss</p>

<p>Dr Alan Smith will commence with a brief explanation of what infrared (IR) technology is and how it differs from normal visual images. Some examples of the diverse applications, together with interesting characteristics of IR thermography, will be shown.   This will be followed by a brief overview of the benefits of IR technology for those carrying out inspections of buildings. The presentation will conclude with a brief case study illustrating some of the advantages and limitations to using the technology.</p>

<p>Dr Alan Smith is a chartered professional engineer and a senior lecturer in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at The University of Melbourne. Alan has a wide range of teaching and research interests having a multidisciplinary PhD that encompassed metal machining, heat transfer and development of numerical methods. Currently, he teaches graduate programmes in production engineering, manufacturing systems, engineering management and quality and reliability.</p>

<p>Alan’s active research interests are concerned with manufacturing systems and quality.  He has been involved in the selection and use of infrared thermographic equipment for almost 25 years. Alan is a level III ITC certified thermographer and has been developing and presenting seminars and courses on thermography since 1994, as well as offering consultations including to the building industry.</p>

<p>We hope to see you there,</p>

<p>Chris Moss and the Melbourne branch committee.</p>
