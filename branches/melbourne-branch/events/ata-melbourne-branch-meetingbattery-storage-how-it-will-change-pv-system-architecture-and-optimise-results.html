<p><strong>Presenter:</strong> David Leyton, Project Manager, Ampetus Energy</p>

<p><strong>Convenor:</strong> Peter Wonfor</p>

<p>Battery storage is poised to change PV system design architecture and make renewable energy systems attractive to a much wider range of customers - large and small. David Leyton, Project Manager at Melbourne-based Ampetus Energy will tell us how and why.</p>

<ul>

<li>Battery prices are dropping as new chemistries and economies of scale kick in.</li>

<li>Onerous battery management and maintenance will become a thing of the past.</li>

<li>Dangerous/toxic materials can now be eliminated on a cradle-to-grave basis.</li>

<li>The system owner, the environment and the power distribution network all win</li>

</ul>

<p>Dropping solar panel prices made PV systems a practical proposition to a much larger potential market. Storage that is modular, expandable and at prices unthinkable until now are about to significantly change the game again, attracting new adopters and offering upgrade benefits to existing system owners.</p>

<p>This is a topic of interest to everyone who has a PV system installed or would have one installed were it not for the negligible feed-in tariffs available for new installations. Come and learn how significant recent developments in storage technology will deliver these benefits and how system design will change to realize them.</p>

<p>David has been involved in the mission critical environment since 1980. For the past five years he has been working in the renewable energies industry. Prior to that he was the Head of Data Centres for Westpac in Sydney. He has a Masters from the University of London and a Bachelors from The University of Western Australia.</p>

<p>The presentation will be followed by Q and A and informal discussion.</p>

<p>We hope to see you there,</p>

<p>Peter Wonfor and the Melbourne branch committee.</p>
