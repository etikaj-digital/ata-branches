<p><strong>Presenters</strong>:  Alan Pears, Donna Luckman</p>

<p>Alan Pears AM is a well-known energy and climate researcher, educator and advocate. He has been working in this area for 40 years and has been writing his regular column in ReNew magazine for over 20 years. He has a strong focus on end users, as it is the demand that frames the ‘need’ for energy supply.</p>

<p>In this session he will focus on residential issues. In particular, he will reflect on the lessons he has taken from his work in the Asia-Pacific region, and his recent visit to Europe and the United Kingdom. He will also explore some of the emerging issues and opportunities as we move to zero emission homes.</p>

<p>Donna Luckman, CEO of the Alternative Technology Association, will provide an update on ATA’s ambitious plans for Australians to live in comfortable, healthy and resilient homes. With the need to accelerate action on sustainable homes and communities it’s time for the organisation to have greater impact and have more people join our community of change.</p>

<p>Donna joined the organisation in 2004 and has over 25 years’ experience working for government, not-for-profit and research organisations. She specialises in leading teams and developing innovative strategies to enact change, from large international programs right down to local community initiatives. Donna has extensive networks in the sustainability sector, is a director of Embark and on the steering committee of the Coalition for Community Energy. She has a Bachelor of Arts from Melbourne University.</p>

<p>Our thanks to Associate Professor Priya Rajagopalan, from the Sustainable Building Information Lab. Trivess Moore will provide a short introduction to their interesting work.<br />
