        <p><strong>When</strong>: Saturday 2 December 2017, 11:00am.<br />

<strong>Where</strong>: Ceres Community and Environment Park Eco house near Lee Street gate, followed by a BBQ at the Village Green (near the Solar Workshop).<br />

<em><strong>Note the change of location. </strong></em>You can find a Google map <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/CERES+Community+Environment+Park/@-37.76578,144.9811548,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6ad6435e295bb43f:0x41761fff9e6748c2!8m2!3d-37.7657843!4d144.9833435">here</a>. A site map of CERES is <a href="http://ceres.org.au/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/CERES-Visitor-Map.pdf">here</a>.<br />

<strong>How to get there</strong>: 96 tram to Blyth St East Brunswick, Northcote train station, Bus 503 or bicycle along the Merri Creek cycle path<br />

<strong>Cost</strong>: Free. A gold coin donation would be appreciated.</p>

<p>The EcoHouse is a typical Brunswick weatherboard house that has been modified to be highly energy efficient and sustainable and demonstrates the effect of the various improvements. We will have a guided tour starting at 11am. More info <a href="http://ceres.org.au/education/green-technology/eco-house/">here</a></p>

<p>Then we go down to the Village Green for a BBQ. It’s essentially BYO, including alcohol if you wish, but there’ll be some bread and salad available. There is some shelter and seating but you are welcome to bring your own chairs and tables and a blanket. However there is no vehicle access. So you will need to carry everything in.</p>

<p>You can catch up on your Christmas shopping at the Nursery, repair your bike at the Bike Shed, see the old ATA workshop, (now offices) and visit the food and handicrafts markets, where there is an abundance of free range foods, and a shop for hard to get health food items and more.</p>

<p>All are welcome - it’s a family friendly place.</p>

<p>Regards, Chris Moss, Rob Gardner and the committee,</p>
