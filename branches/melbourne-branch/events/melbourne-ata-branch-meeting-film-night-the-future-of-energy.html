<p><strong>The Future of Energy</strong><br />

This film by Brett Mazurek, Maximilian DeArmon, Missy Lahren &amp; Theo Badashi was shown at the Transitions Film Festival in Melbourne on 21 February this year and received a great response. We are pleased to be able to present it at our September meeting. More details of the film are on the Transitions Film Festival website <a href="http://www.transitionsfilmfestival.com/screenings/the-future-of-energy/">here</a> and the film website itself is <a href="http://www.thefutureofenergy.org">here</a>.</p>

<p>A summary of the film taken from the website says "The Future of Energy: Lateral Power to the People is a positive, fun film that focuses on energy solutions and the people behind the renewable energy revolution. It\'s a love story about people re-imagining their relationship to the planet, and falling back in love with the Earth and each other."<br />

The film runs for 1 hr 15 min. which leaves time for a discussion about issues raised by the film and informal conversations over tea/coffee following the movie (the latter subject to facilities availability).<br />

This is a great opportunity to see a film that is unlikely to be widely distributed. We have been offered a theatre-style lecture room for this meeting with a capacity of 160, so please feel free to invite guests to this meeting!</p>

<p><strong>Convenor</strong>: Peter Wonfor<br />
