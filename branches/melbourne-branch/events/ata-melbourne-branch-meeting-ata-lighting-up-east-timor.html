<p><strong>You can view Kate\'s presentation <a href="http://community.ata.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Kate-presentation-at-ATA-Melbourne-branch-18-May-2016_2.pdf">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Since 2003 ATA has installed over 1000 solar lighting and power units in homes, community centres, orphanages, schools and medical facilities in remote rural villages in East Timor.</p>

<p>In Late 2014, ATA secured a Google grant for $250,000 to further develop the Village Lighting Scheme (VLS) project, including development of a much upgraded in-house developed integrated solar system and development of an online mapping and project tracking database.</p>

<p>Kate Greenwood joined the ATA recently as the new International Projects Manager with extensive experience in international community development projects. She will explain the planned program for the second half of 2016 to install up to 800 solar units in remote villages. She will discuss the challenges and methodology including the focus on community ownership and management, training of local technicians, capacity building of Timorese partner organisations and coordination with the Timorese Government. Kate will explain how development of a robust monitoring and evaluation plan will enable the ATA to measure the environmental, social, health and economic benefits of the project and provide evidence of impact and learning for future project plans.</p>

<p>Maja is a PhD (Engineering) student at RMIT University. She is working on designing a hybrid solar photovoltaic/thermal collector and her interests include how solar technologies can assist with development, leading her to volunteer with the ATA and Engineers Without Borders (EWB).  Maja will talk about the village lighting system, what is unique about this version, the technical specs and data collection capabilities as well as her visit to East Timor on one of the pilot trips with the ATA last year. She will also discuss some examples of solar programs around Asia and what makes a good and replicable program.</p>

<p>There will be a Q&amp;A session which may include “how do you get 40 solar units (weighing 13kg each) up a mountain cliff?” and “what volunteering and support is possible?”….</p>

<p>Regards, Peter and the Melbourne branch committee.</p>
