<p><strong>Cape Project</strong></p>

<p>The Cape Project is situated on a large block of land on the edge of Cape Patterson in Gippsland about an hour and 40 minutes from Melbourne. It is going to be one of the most sustainable developments in Australia, with sustainable energy efficient housing with solar power, food gardens, rainwater collection and protection of natural habitat between the development and the sea, where there is a nice beach. Electric vehicles will be catered for with charging points<br />
