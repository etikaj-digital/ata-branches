<p><strong>Presentation</strong>:<strong> Fuel Cells, Energy Efficiency and Climate Change Action:</strong><br />

<strong>An evening with Stuart Nesbitt, City of Moreland Climate Change Technical Officer.</strong></p>

<p>Moreland City Council is well know for being one of the more environmentally aware Councils in Melbourne. One of their current projects aims to use waste collection vehicles powered by 100% renewable hydrogen. See their website <a href="http://moreland.vic.gov.au/about-us/projects/environmental-projects/renewable-hydrogen-waste-truck/">here</a> for more details on this innovative program.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker bio:</strong> Stuart Nesbitt has been instrumental in major public lighting projects - cogeneration, the creation of a public electric vehicle recharging network, HVAC &amp; hot water system upgrades and building retrofits to name a few, and more recently implementing commercial scale solar PV installations and developing the renewable hydrogen fleet fuel project for Councils heavy fleet. Stuart started his career in the Automotive Industry as a motor mechanic, worked in both private enterprise and local government in light &amp; heavy fleet maintenance, progressing to workshop supervision, apprentice training and ultimately fleet management. In 2000 he opted for a career change and began studying renewable energy technology at Swinburne University. He has worked for a number of local Councils including Hume City Council as Sustainable Resources Technical Officer, Darebin as Climate Change Action Officer and joined Moreland City Council in 2010 as the Climate Change Technical Officer to project manage the energy efficiency program under their Carbon Management Strategy. His role is primarily to reduce Councils carbon footprint across its buildings, public lighting and fleet operations.</p>

<p>In 2015 he was the winner of the National Energy Efficiency Councils prestigious annual ‘Energy Efficiency Champion’ award. His position is still one of few in local government that manage their energy efficiency programs using an in-house technical project officer with a mechanical engineering background.</p>

<p>* We recognise and appreciate the assistance of the University of Melbourne <a href="http://energy-transition-hub.org/">Energy Transition Hub</a> in hosting this event.</p>

<p>We hope to see you on the evening.</p>

<p>Regards,<br />

Chris Moss, Melbourne branch committee.<br />
