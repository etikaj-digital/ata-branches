<p><strong>Presenters</strong>: Andrew Rothberg and Deanne Labbett</p>

<p><a href="https://www.energy.vic.gov.au/energy-efficiency/victorian-energy-upgrades">Victorian Energy Upgrades</a> (established under the Victorian Energy Efficiency Target Act 2007) provides <strong>financial</strong> incentives to Victorian households and businesses for energy saving upgrades. Andrew will provide an update about recent changes to the program, and will explain how households and businesses can participate to receive an upgrade. He will also explain how businesses can participate to deliver energy saving upgrades under the program.<br />

The Victorian Residential Efficiency Scorecard, or the Scorecard for short, is an Australian-first home energy rating program. The Scorecard gives you a star rating for your home, in the same way as a fridge or washing machine can get a star rating. The star rating represents the running cost of the fixed appliances in your home. You can use it as a guide to make home improvements efficiently and cost effectively. Deanne will provide an overview of how people can participate to have a Scorecard assessment, or become an assessor.</p>

<p>A<strong>ndrew Rothberg</strong> is a Senior Policy Officer at the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning where he works on the Victorian Energy Upgrades program. He has worked on energy efficiency and renewable energy projects for nearly a decade, across local and state government and the not for profit sector. His focus has been on developing programs and models to accelerate the uptake of energy efficiency and clean energy across Victoria.</p>

<p><strong>Deanne Labbett</strong> works in the Scorecard team at the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning. She has extensive knowledge in the thermal performance of buildings, particularly for residential buildings and works in both the administration of the Scorecard program, as well as the technical side - understanding and developing the Scorecard webtool.</p>

<p>Please feel free to invite friends and colleagues; our meetings are open to members and guests.  We look forward to seeing you there!</p>

<p>Regards, Chris Moss and the committee,</p>
