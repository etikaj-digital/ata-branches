<p><strong>Presentation</strong>: Toxic and Terminal<br />

The Melbourne branch of the Alternative Technology Association (<a href="http://www.ata.org.au/">ATA</a>) present Bronya Lipski (<a href="https://www.envirojustice.org.au">EJA</a>) and Tim Eaton (EPA).</p>

<p>Environmental Justice Australia’s report Toxic and Terminal: How the regulation of coal-fired power stations fails Australian communities is the result of exhaustive research, Freedom of Information searches, surveillance of 10 major power stations on Australia’s east coast, and advice from health experts and industry whistle-blowers. Prepared by lawyers and air pollution experts, this report finds:</p>

<ul>

<li>Coal-fired power stations emit more than 30 toxic substances and are Australia’s biggest source of fine particles (PM2.5), sulphur dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen.</li>

<li>These substances cause and contribute to a range of health impacts including asthma, lung cancer, heart attack, stroke, and respiratory disease in nearby communities.</li>

<li>In most cases emissions limits in Australia are much more lax than those in the US, EU and China.</li>

<li>Mercury limits for some NSW power stations are 666 times higher than the US limits.</li>

<li>Pollution reduction technologies that have been available for many years and are used overseas could significantly reduce power station emissions but are not in use in Australia.</li>

<li>New coal-fired power stations, even those described as ‘ultra-supercritical’ or ‘HELE’ (high efficiency, low emission) only marginally reduce toxic emissions.</li>

<li>Despite much evidence of failure to comply with pollution licence conditions, no power station in Victoria, NSW or Queensland has been prosecuted for any offence in the past ten years. Instead, they have been issued with inadequate penalty notices.</li>

</ul>

<p>Bronya Lipski, co-author of Toxic and Terminal will explain the key findings of the report and run through how you can have your say on the EPA Victoria’s current review of the licences for Victoria’s power station licences.</p>

<p>Tim Eaton will speak on EPA’s regulation of power station emissions and the National Pollution Inventory (NPI)</p>
