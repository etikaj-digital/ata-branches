<p><strong>Presenter: Taryn Lane (Embark and Hepburn Wind)</strong></p>

<p>Taryn runs Communications &amp; Community Liaison at Embark and has worked for Hepburn Wind, Australia\'s first community-owned wind farm since 2010 delivering industry best standards in community engagement. She is a founding director of the Australian Wind Alliance and founding member of the steering committee for the Coalition for Community Energy (C4CE).</p>

<p><a href="http://embark.com.au">Embark</a> is a not-for-profit set up to kick-start the community energy sector in Australia; through that she supports other communities to build their own renewable energy projects for the benefit of their communities.</p>

<p><a href="http://hepburnwind.com.au">Hepburn Wind</a> is Australia\'s first community-owned cooperative wind farm. The wind farm has pioneered the community energy movement in Australia and has been recognised with national and global awards for its unique approach to community engagement.</p>

<p>Taryn holds a BA in International Studies and a MA in Sustainability and Social Change. She is clearly well qualified and experienced to inform us about the potential of Community Energy and how it can play a major part in transitioning Australia to 100% renewable energy. She will be able to introduce us to the identification of potential projects and how to get them off the ground.</p>

<p>We anticipate yet another interesting Q&amp;A session following Taryn\'s presentation.</p>

<p>Regards, Peter and the Melbourne branch committee.</p>
