<p><strong>Presentation</strong>:<strong> </strong>In October 2017, the Victorian Government asked Infrastructure Victoria to provide advice on what infrastructure is required to pave the way for highly automated and zero emissions vehicles in the state. In providing this advice, IV were asked to consider a number of potential future scenarios, consult broadly with stakeholders, and build a strong body of evidence based on comprehensive modelling, analysis and global experience.<br />

In August 2018, Infrastructure Victoria released its Evidence Base report. This report provides an overview of the Victorian-specific evidence gathered by Infrastructure Victoria to inform its advice, ranging from transport, energy, ICT, land use and the environment.<br />

This presentation will delve further into the findings of Infrastructure Victoria’s research, across all these subject areas including some of the key insights, unexpected outcomes, and myths that have been busted along the way. The presentation will also include Infrastructure Victoria’s view on the key risks and opportunities associated with automated and zero emissions technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker bio</strong>: Steve Connors is a Principal Adviser for Infrastructure Victoria\'s Automated and Zero Emissions Vehicles Infrastructure Advice. With degrees in both economics and political science, and a decade of public and private sector experience, Steve has worked on multiple State budgets, health service planning, and public transport franchise agreements.<br />

Steve joined the project team is in early 2018 as the lead author of Infrastructure Victoria’s advice on the state’s infrastructure needs for introducing automated and zero emissions vehicles. The breadth of this work is unprecedented in Australia and around the world, looking 30 years into the future on topics such as transport modelling and planning, energy networks, ICT infrastructure and socioeconomic outcomes.</p>

<p>* We recognise and appreciate the assistance of the University of Melbourne <a href="http://energy-transition-hub.org/">Energy Transition Hub</a> in providing the venue for this event.</p>

<p>We hope to see you on the evening.</p>

<p>Regards,<br />

Chris Moss, Melbourne branch committee.<br />
