<p><strong>Meeting Convenor:</strong> Chris Moss</p>

<p><strong>Speaker: Matt Sullivan – Head of Research, Moreland Energy Foundation</strong></p>

<p>Matthew Sullivan has recently completed extensive research into a number of energy efficiency retrofit technologies:-</p>

<p>•    On-Ground Assessments – field studies which implement a range of retrofit technologies (from draught sealing to wall insulation to appliance upgrade). Discussion on costs of measures, issues encountered and benefits obtained</p>

<p>•    Multi-unit residential building ESD (Environmentally Sustainable Design). Discussion on energy consumption profiles, actual thermal performance correlated against rated performance, and current best practice in ESD.</p>

<p>Matt has a Masters in energy studies and bachelor degrees in mechatronics engineering and computer science. In addition to the years spent working in industrial automation, he has gained experience in energy efficiency and renewable energy working as a consultant for several firms and leading the sustainability assistance program for Engineers Without Borders. He is involved with a number of environmental awareness and activist groups including Beyond Zero Emissions and the Australian Institute of Energy.</p>

<p>Matt\'s presentation can be found <a href="http://community.ata.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ATA-Melb-20-Nov-2013-presentation.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Bring along some good ideas for future meetings and we are keen to get some new members onto the committee. The tasks are not at all onerous; suggesting and arranging suitable topics and meeting a few times a year.</p>
