        <p><strong>When</strong>: Wednesday 18 July 2018, 6.45 for 7:00pm<br />

<strong>Where</strong>: Engineering (EN) Building, Swinburne University, Hawthorn Campus, Room EN515 (if you are unfamiliar with this location view or download this <a href="http://www.swinburne.edu.au/media/swinburneeduau/about-swinburne/docs/pdfs/hawthorn-map.pdf">Hawthorn campus map</a>).<br />

<strong>Cost</strong>: Free. (A gold coin donation would be appreciated to offset costs.)</p>

<p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Matthew Charles-Jones, Community Energy Engagement, Mondo Power.</p>

<p>Matthew Charles-Jones has incredible experience in Community Renewable Energy and the technologies that make projects such as <a href="http://totallyrenewableyack.org.au">Totally Renewable Yackandandah</a> a reality. Matt was heavily involved with Totally Renewable Yackandandah and thus has first-hand knowledge not only of the enabling technologies but also the significance of community involvement. He will be able to tell us how that project got off the ground to become a standard against which future projects will be judged.<br />

We will also have an introduction to how the all-important Mini and Micro Grids work, and how, as a subsidiary of AusNet Services, Mondo Power is leading the way!<br />

Mondo Power is an independent subsidiary of AusNet Services Ltd based in Melbourne. Mondo Power specialises in advanced energy management solutions for both commercial and community partners with a focus on distributed energy offerings.<br />

Mondo™ Power has developed Mondo™ Ubi™ – an advanced energy monitoring and management system that delivers accurate and timely energy consumption information.</p>

<p>As always, please feel free to invite friends and colleagues; our meetings are open to members and guests.</p>
