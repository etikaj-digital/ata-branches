<p>Welcome back for the New Year. We kick off with a double header exploring some wider responses to the issues of climate change.</p>

<p>We are trialling the second floor of the ATA office  as a venue as it is easy to get to and has refreshment facilities. It also can be a less formal space than Swinburne.</p>

<p><strong>Convenor</strong>: Chris Moss</p>

<p><strong>Dominique Hes: Natural systems for a healthy energy efficiency home</strong></p>

<p>We are all very aware of the technical fixes for energy efficiency: appropriate sealing, insulation, material and colour selection, highly rated appliances, thermal mass, and so forth. Many of us do not stop to think that there are natural systems that can not only improve our energy efficiency but also provide many other benefits. This talk will focus those benefits while highlighting the energy opportunities. This will be done in the context of the University of Melbourne shading and green roof projects, the positive net energy home retrofits for Moreland project and the international work on the benefits of integrating nature into and around homes.</p>

<p>Dominique Hes is a lecturer and researcher in sustainability in the built environment. She is interested in critiquing the current efficiency approach to sustainability. We are continuing to degrade our ecological capital yet we have been \'doing\' sustainability since Silent Spring. She asks, what are different models we can look at to imagine a thriving abundant future?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Rob Salter: Living well in Yarra</strong></p>

<p>Dr Rob Salter will outline Livewell Clusters, a new model of community engagement that will be trialled in the City of Yarra from 5 March. A major challenge in dealing with climate change is persuading larger numbers of ordinary people to act, both to reduce their own emissions and to advocate for appropriate policies. Livewell seeks to do this though a strong focus on the wellbeing gains to be made, a lightly structured process to facilitate personal reductions, and ongoing active recruitment of participants, within a participant-run organisation. Come along and hear how it will happen!</p>

<p>Rob is a senior research fellow at Curtin University Sustainability Policy (CUSP) Institute, and prior to that lectured in the Social Sciences and worked in a range of community sector positions. Though working for Curtin he lives in inner suburban Melbourne and loves the life it offers and the possibilities for sustainability.</p>

<p>We hope to see you at the meeting,</p>
