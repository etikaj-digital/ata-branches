        <p><strong>When</strong>: Wednesday 19 October 2016, 6.45 for 7:00pm<br />

<strong>Where</strong>: Engineering (EN) Building, Swinburne University, Hawthorn Campus, Room EN515 (if you are unfamiliar with this location view or download this <a href="http://www.swinburne.edu.au/media/swinburneeduau/about-swinburne/docs/pdfs/hawthorn-map.pdf">Hawthorn campus map</a>).<br />

<strong>Cost</strong>: Free. (A gold coin donation would be appreciated to offset costs.)</p>

<p>Tim Forcey is well known to ATA members, and we will be treated to another informative presentation by Tim, this time about saving money (and helping the environment) by using less gas without compromising the desired result.</p>

<p>Tim is an ATA volunteer; energy researcher with Melbourne University; and formerly manager with Jemena, BHP Billiton, and Esso. He will present on the biggest Victorian consumer win going around: replacing gas use in the home with modern electrically-powered alternatives.</p>

<p>Following the presentation, Tim will be happy to discuss all aspects of gas use in Australia (and its alternatives). Tim would also like to discuss how ATA members can help spread the message of gas-replacement benefits throughout the community.</p>

<p>Some of Tim’s publications are featured <a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/tim-forcey-104740/articles">here</a>.</p>

<p>Regards, Peter and the Melbourne branch committee.</p>
