<p>Powerstar voltage optimisation systems offer unique, patented energy saving solutions that match the incoming electricity supply to the needs of onsite equipment, inducing real negative power in the third winding­. Powerstar systems provide savings on electricity bills, reduce electricity consumption, extend equipment longevity and cut carbon emissions for businesses. Powerstar industrial and commercial products are in use worldwide (including Australia) and domestic single and 3-phase products are available in some countries.</p>

<p>Ben will describe the technology and the kind of benefits that have been proven worldwide and endorsed by major companies with a sharp eye on the benefits of any investment. While not marketed as per the Powerstar range, the domestic product is sold in Australia and Ben will describe the domestic product and the situations in which it has proved its capabilities.</p>

<p>Ben Gulinello has just joined the EMSC Asia Pacific group, based in Malvern in Victoria, as the Technical Sales Engineer.</p>

<p>Ben has over 20 years experience in the Electrical Power Industry, mainly in the areas of Protection, Control and SCADA systems. Before joining the EMSC Asia Pacific Group Ben was with ABB for 20 years, where he performed Account Management and Design Engineering.</p>
