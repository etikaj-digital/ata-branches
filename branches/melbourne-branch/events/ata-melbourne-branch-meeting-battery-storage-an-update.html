<p><strong>Presenter</strong>: John Ballis, CEO, GridEdge</p>

<p>Battery Storage systems for PV systems continue to be a hot topic, and we are fortunate to have a presentation by John Ballis of GridEdge lined up to bring us up to date with what\'s happening in this fascinating sector of the market.</p>

<p>John will give as a recap on both what comprises a storage system and what needs to be done prior to committing to a purchase in order to ensure the storage system matches not only the PV array but much more importantly the types of load and the power usage pattern it needs to work with.</p>

<p>We\'ll learn what critical functions the battery management system (BMS) performs, and John will give us insight into the importance of where storage systems can be physically located and how the choice of battery technology can significantly affect this - and the cost of the installed system.</p>

<p>We anticipate many attendees will ultimately be adding storage to an existing PV system as prices fall, electricity costs and FITs change and the "storage crystal ball" transitions from being a bit murky into something obviously sparkling and highly attractive. Therefore John will give us insight into the planning of an "add-on" storage system compared with that for a complete PV plus storage new installation. So feel free to come armed with questions pertinent to your specific needs!</p>
