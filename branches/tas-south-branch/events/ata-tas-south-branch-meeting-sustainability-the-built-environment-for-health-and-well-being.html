<p><strong>Where</strong>: The Duke of Welllington Hotel, 192 Macquarie Street, Hobart</p>

<p><strong>Presentation</strong>: ‘Sustainability; the built environment for health and well being’, Presented by Robin Nolan a Life Fellow of the Planning Institute of Australia.</p>

<p>The talk relates to, and builds on, the ATA website that notes the need to ‘inspire and assist people to make sustainable choices in their homes and communities\', and is very relevant in light of the proposed changes to planning schemes to the making of the Tasmanian Planning Scheme.</p>

<p>Rob has been a member of the Planning Institute of Australia from 1974, and Fellow since 1988. He has held various senior roles in the planning community including planning director of the Southern Metropolitan Planning Authority, and Deputy Commissioner for Town and Country Planning and delegate for the Tasmanian Planning Commission. Having retired from the Tasmanian Planning Commission in 2011 Rob is assisting the Heart Foundation Tasmania in their advocacy for the making of a State Policy for Healthy Spaces and Places.</p>

<p>All ATA members and Renew subscribers are encouraged to attend our monthly talks and bring along guests. The talk will be given in the upstairs meeting room at The Duke of Wellington. Entry is from the stairs at the side. Drinks are available at the bar upstairs, and meals can be ordered from the bar downstairs before the meeting.</p>
