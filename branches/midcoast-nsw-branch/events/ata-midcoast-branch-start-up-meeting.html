<p>We are planning to have an initial meeting to see if we can set up and discuss the future role of an ATA Branch on the MidCoast of NSW. Doug Rolfe from ATA headquarters has offered to come to the meeting to support our efforts and give us advice on how to proceed with the process. The plan is to have the meeting at the 2 Bob meeting hall.</p>

<p>The aim of the meeting is to discuss interest in forming a local branch and to form an interim committee. A survey will also be conducted with interested members to assess individual preferences for what times of the day and days of the week that meetings should be conducted. We can also discuss the types of sustainability activities that the group is interested in attending and promoting such as having regular presentations on various sustainability topics at every meeting where non members can also be invited to attend and,/or promoting or initiating sustainability events and any other special activities. We can also gauge member interest in setting up stalls at community gatherings such as Energise Gloucester and the Envirofair to promote sustainable living and and publicise our group. This can all be discussed at the initial meeting and we are also planning some interesting short presentations for the evening.</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing you at the initial meeting.</p>

<p>Best Regards, Greg Berry, Andy Colvin and Doug Rolfe</p>
