        <p><em><strong>The presentation will be preceded by our annual elections(should be quite brief), where there are a couple of positions on the committee which have become available, so please consider putting your hand up to help the group continue to operate.</strong></em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Presenter </b>: Riccardo Pagliarella</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> The meeting will be held in the Engineering Building, in room EN615, at Swinburne University, Hawthorn campus. For a map of Swinburne <a href="http://www.ata.org.au/wp-content/uploads/Swinburne-map.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Gold coin donation toward tea/coffee.</p>

<p>Riccardo is a Mechanical Engineer and Aerodynamicist.  He is currently standing as a Committee member of Standards Australia, setting standards for EV charging.  He also holds a position as Environment Policy Manager at Toyota Motor Corporation.</p>

<p>Previously Riccardo was a Design Engineer for Tesla Motors, &amp; an Aerodynamicist for the Renault F1 racing team.</p>

<p>Education :  PhD in Vehicle Aerodynamics At RMIT, Bachelor of Engineering with Honours at University of Melbourne. Bachelor of Commerce at University of Melbourne</p>

<p>We anticipate an interesting discussion on the state of the EV industry in Australia, and the emerging standards for charging infrastructure.</p>

<p><b>We suggest you forward this invitation to the Sustainability Officer or similar at your local council, and any other networks you think may appreciate learning about the future of EV infrastructure.</b></p>

<p>For those interested in sharing dinner beforehand from 6pm, several of us meet informally at a curry cafe across the road at 424 Burwood Rd, formally called Funky Curry, now called Only Vegetarian Kitchen (which is not strictly true, they cater to non-vego\'s too!)..  Check out details <a href="http://melbournemenusonline.com.au/only-vegetarian-kitchen-indian-restaurant-hawthorn/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Also, if you would like to attend the Formula SAE-A comp in Werribee in a couple of weeks, we plan to have a bit of a Christmas break-up gathering there on December 15th.. Keep your eye out for details.</p>

<p>We look forward to seeing you soon!</p>

<p>Thanks &amp; Regards.</p>
