        <p>Tasmanian delegates to the 2014 Community Energy Congress will share stories and provide information and resources to help communities develop their own community renewable energy projects. Projects might involve the generation of electricity from wind or solar, like the community owned Hepburn Wind project, or could be a biomass fuelled heating scheme. The type of scheme will vary from community to community depending on their local needs and resources.</p>

<p>Community renewable energy projects provide multiple benefits:</p>

<ul>

<li>the community owns the project, and so profits are kept within the community</li>

<li>in some cases, the project sells energy directly to members of the community, keeping money that would have left the community in the community</li>

<li>the community controls the energy and so has more control over an essential service and its impact on the local environment</li>

<li>more renewable energy is generated and used.</li>

</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Speakers:</strong></p>

<p>David Hamilton is the Chairman of Dorset Renewable Industries, who are considering biomass based community energy projects for the Dorset region, such as a wood to ethanol plant. David is also the Convenor of the Tas North Branch of the ATA.</p>

<p>Jack Gilding is the Executive Officer of the Tasmanian Renewable Energy Alliance and was previously the Executive Officer of Hepburn Wind. He has been active in a number of project to research and promote the potential of community renewable energy projects.</p>
