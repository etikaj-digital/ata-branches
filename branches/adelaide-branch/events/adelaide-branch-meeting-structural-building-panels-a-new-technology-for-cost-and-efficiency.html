<p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Warwick Prestwood - <a href="http://www.nutekbuildingsystems.com.au/">Nu-Tek Building Systems</a>.</p>

<p>Nu-Tek Building Systems has developed a load bearing structural wall panel and are producing them at their Monarto factory. Panel sizes and external and internal claddings are according to the individual design. This means a highly individual appearance and allows flexibility in design. The designer is not limited by standard sizes or a small choice of claddings. Thermal insulation is a 100 mm foam core. Door and window openings are cut and services etc are installed during manufacture. This means an overall faster and more energy efficient method of manufacturing and on-site construction. Site waste is reduced and trades are not working on top of each other with associated site safety risks.</p>

<p>Due to the structural strength of the roof panels, a home can be built with a small footprint. These don’t require roof trusses and rooms can be built in the roof space. This gives a lower cost per square metre than traditional methods.</p>

<p>You can read their press release <a href="http://www.nutekbuildingsystems.com.au/news.php">here</a>. You can watch the video of the presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bc3Q2FJils">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: In the video mention is made of the toxic products produced by EPS. It is important to note that the softening temperature of EPS is 80-90°C and the auto-ignition temperature is around 450°C. Many insulation products can release toxic materials under different fire conditions. For more on the different combustion temperatures and emissions of different building materials refer to the recent independent report by CSIRO for the Bushfire CRC, 2011 (<a href="http://www.bushfirecrc.com/sites/default/files/managed/resource/inventory.pdf">here</a>).</p>
