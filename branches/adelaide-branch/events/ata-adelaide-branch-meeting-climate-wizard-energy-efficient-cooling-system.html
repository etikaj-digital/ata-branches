        <p><strong>When</strong>: Monday 17 November, 7.30pm sharp. <strong>Note</strong>: Last meeting for 2014<br />

<strong>Where</strong>: Goodwood Community Centre (Banquet Hall), 32/34 Rosa St, Goodwood SA Goodwood Community Centre is convenient to the tram, buses and train. Enter the car park via Florence St.<br />

<strong>Cost</strong>: ATA members $2. Non-members $5, Tea, coffee and biscuits provided.</p>

<p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Frank Seeley AM: Founder and Executive Chairman of Seeley International.</p>

<p>Frank\'s business life began in the early 1970s, first selling then manufacturing evaporative coolers. To overcome corrosion he developed the industry\'s first all-plastic coolers. This innovation saw the Australian rooftop cooler market increase from 12,000 units a year to around 70,000.</p>

<p>Seeley International now employs over 370 people and exports to more than120 countries. The company manufactures coolers at Lonsdale, SA and gas heating systems at the factory in Albury, NSW. Sales offices are in each mainland state, the USA, Western Europe and South Africa.</p>

<p>Seeley International is Australia’s only air conditioning and heating manufacturer with NATA (National Association of Testing Authorities) accreditation. In October 2014 the company opened its purpose-built test laboratory at Lonsdale. This is used for development and performance testing of evaporative coolers, refrigerated air conditioners and heat pumps.</p>

<p>Seeley International\'s Climate Wizard is a highly efficient indirect evaporative air conditioning system that\'s designed for a wide range of applications. It produces much colder air than conventional evaporative coolers and doesn\'t add any moisture. Cooling performance increases as ambient temperature rises.</p>

<p>Using indirect heat transfer means the unit doesn\'t add moisture - which underpins the operation of traditional direct heat transfer evaporative systems. On a 30 deg C day the Climate Wizard\'s cooled air temperature is typically 19 degrees but from a direct system is around 23 degrees.</p>

<p>The Climate Wizard uses up to 80% less energy than a refrigerated air conditioning system under the same operating conditions and vastly reduces cooling costs. All cooled air is fresh giving a healthy inside atmosphere and mitigates sick building syndrome.</p>

<p>The system alone can provide a building\'s cooling needs or may be used as a pre-cooler to a refrigerated air conditioning system. It can also be retro-fitted for this purpose to reduce the running costs and mechanical-electrical load of an existing system. On new systems it allows a smaller refrigeratedair conditioning system to be used.</p>

<p>Frank, his company and its products have won many awards for innovation and sustainability including the following:</p>

<ul>

<li>2013 Australian Business Award for Innovation</li>

<li>Ernst and Young Champion of Entrepreneurship, 2013</li>

<li>Middle East Climate Control Awards 2013</li>

<li>Business SA 2013 Export Awards Winner: Environmental Solutions</li>

<li>Big 5 International Building and Construction Show, Dubai</li>

<li>Banksia Award for energy efficiency and carbon management</li>

<li>US Dealer Design Awards</li>

<li>World Agricultural Expo, California, Top 10 New Products.</li>

</ul>
