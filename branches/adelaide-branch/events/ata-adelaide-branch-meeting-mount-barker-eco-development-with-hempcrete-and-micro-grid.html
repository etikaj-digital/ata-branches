<p><strong>Presentation:  </strong></p>

<p>Lia and Graeme Parsons are co-founders of Miller’s Corner. The site has been their family home for 21yrs and they aim to create a model for sustainable living that will inspire others.</p>

<p>Miller’s Corner is a 13 dwelling eco-housing development in the heart of Mt Barker, nestled in the beautiful Adelaide Hills. Social integration and sustainability are key themes for this community, designed to encourage social interaction and participation.</p>

<p>Sustainability is addressed using a passive solar design and the choices of materials such as hempcrete (for walls) and timber milled on the site. Another key feature is the micro grid electric network designed by SA Power Networks and includes electric vehicle charging facilities in the car park.</p>

<p>The heart and soul of the development is the Forest House where community members can gather for social occasions and working bees. The subdivision includes a communal orchard and veggie gardens, open spaces and secret hideaways.</p>

<p><strong>Next meeting</strong></p>

<p>The next meeting will be on 15 May 2017 – see the newsletter for details.</p>

<p>As always, the Committee invites suggestions for presentations and feedback regarding what they want from ATA meetings - send to <a href="mailto:adelaidebranch@ata.org.au">adelaidebranch@ata.org.au</a></p>

<p><strong>Seeley Visit</strong><br />

Might you be interested in a branch visit to the Seeley International factory at Lonsdale, early evening on a weekday? Frank Seeley spoke to the branch last year about their Climate Wizard high efficiency air conditioning system and this would be a chance to see it close up and possibly under test. If so, email <a href="mailto:adelaidebranch@ata.org.au">adelaidebranch@ata.org.au</a> with \'Seeley Visit\' in the subject line.</p>

<p><strong>Q&amp;A</strong></p>

<p>ATA meetings put people with questions in touch with people who might have answers. The Q&amp;A session is an open discussion about sustainability topics.</p>

<p>Meetings are open to ATA members and non-members. They aim to be informative and interactive in helping people to learn about living and building sustainability. We look forward to seeing you.</p>
