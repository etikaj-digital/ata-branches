<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>

<p>Architect Emilis Prelgauskas is a regular and popular presenter at ATA meetings who usually talks about energy-efficient building design. Tonight he’ll describe his community involvement following devastating bushfires such as Sampson Flat and Pinery. He and other professionals provided pro bono advice to bushfire-affected families about rebuilding their homes and their lives.</p>

<p>Emilis observes the link between where we live and the people we are. Conserving the best of the past, preparing for the ‘new normal’, meeting current regulations and dealing with insurance claims is a challenge. His decades of experience with building processes and bushfire response allow him to make a positive contribution to this complex mix.</p>

<p>Emilis has been involved in 14 fire events in the last 5 years including logistics for veterinarians and triaging animals. He’s the author of the ‘Bushfire’ section of the Federal Government’s ‘<a href="https://shop.ata.org.au/shop/your-home-5th-edition">Your Home Technical Manual</a>\', Edition 4.</p>

<p>Meetings are open to ATA members and non-members. They aim to be informative and interactive in helping people to learn about living and building sustainability. We look forward to seeing you.</p>
