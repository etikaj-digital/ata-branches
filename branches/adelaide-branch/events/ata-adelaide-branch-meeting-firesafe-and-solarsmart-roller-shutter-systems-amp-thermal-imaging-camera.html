<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>CW Products of Murray Bridge manufactures a range of aluminium window shutters that provide shade, thermal insulation and security. Their Sales Manager Paul Denton will present the company\'s Firesafe and SolarSmart roller shutter systems.</p>

<p>The Firesafe is for those living close to wooded and high vegetation areas where bushfire is a distinct risk. It\'s designed to shield windows from flying debris and extreme heat radiation. It complies with AS3959 and is rated to Bushfire Attack Level A40. It may be hand operated or use a motorised drive with remote control. The SolarSmart shutter\'s motorised drive is powered by a solar panel-regulator-battery combination that\'s mounted on or close to the shutter pelmet. As there\'s no mains wiring, no electrician is required to install the system.</p>

<p><strong>Thermal imaging camera: </strong>The ATA Adelaide Branch has purchased a FLIR E4 thermal imaging camera for hire to members. This will be presented to the meeting.</p>

<p><strong>Q&amp;A / Show and Tell session: </strong>ATA meetings put people with questions in touch with people who might have answers. The Q&amp;A session is an open discussion about sustainability topics. If you have a useful gadget that helps energy efficiency and can be explained in a few minutes, bring it along to show and tell us about it.</p>

<p><strong>Adelaide Branch election</strong></p>

<p>All positions will be declared vacant and elections for the Convenor, Treasurer and Committee will be held.</p>

<p>Branch meetings are open to ATA members and non-members. They aim to be informative and interactive in helping people to learn about living and building sustainability. We look forward to seeing you.</p>
