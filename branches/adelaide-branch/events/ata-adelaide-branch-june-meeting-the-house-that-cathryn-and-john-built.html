<p><strong>Presenters</strong>: Cathryn Hamilton and John Zeppel, home owner-builders</p>

<p>Another inspirational case study of how an energy efficient home was conceived, designed, project managed and built.</p>

<p>The aim was to create an energy efficient home that would match houses in the area. Since it was completed in 2013, owner-builders Cathryn and John have had time to monitor energy performance and water consumption through hot and cold weather. They also monitored construction costs and energy savings.</p>

<p>Design was by Energy Architecture and ATA Branch Committee member Cathryn, managed and site supervised the project. Building was by local contractors who were not necessarily experienced in sustainable house construction.</p>

<p>Features include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Reverse brick veneer – insulated timber frame clad with BGC Duratex and rendered.</li>

<li>Veneered limestone features to street frontage to reflect character of area.</li>

<li>High thermal mass - polished concrete floor, brick walls, concrete core in centre of house.</li>

<li>Double glazing, UPVC windows Zendow design, tilt and turn for cross ventilation.</li>

<li>In-floor hydronic heating and cooling – Thermocold heat pump 14 kW.</li>

<li>Electric heat pump hot water system (Sanden). Hot water circulation.</li>

<li>5.5kW Tindo PV panels.</li>

<li>10 kL rainwater storage - filtered, UV disinfected and plumbed into house.</li>

<li>Low VOC products Australian made where possible.</li>

<li>Some recycled content if quality not compromised.</li>

</ul>
