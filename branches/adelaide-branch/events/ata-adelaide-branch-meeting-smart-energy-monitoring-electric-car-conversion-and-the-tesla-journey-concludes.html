<p><strong>Presentations: </strong></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Smart Energy Monitor</span>. Adelaide engineer Tisham Dhar began building compact, low cost monitors as a hobby and now sells them internationally. The monitor shows where electricity is being consumed, records this data and uploads to the internet enabling tracking.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Electric Car Conversion</span>. Eric Rodda, Adelaide Secretary of the Australian Electric Vehicle Association will talk about his conversion of a Holden Barina to electric drive and possibly converting his Prius to plug-in with additional batteries. He will be bringing the Barina along for inspection.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Going the distance with Tesla</span>: At our May meeting Shawn Zeppel gave an account of the first stage of a Tesla’s long distance performance monitoring journey. Tonight he’ll conclude with the car’s overall performance, problems encountered and lessons learned.</p>

<p><strong>Other events: </strong></p>

<p><strong>Adelaide Sustainable Building Network</strong> has two events planned for August - see their Facebook page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AdelaideSustainableBuildingNetwork/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Thermal camera: </strong>To encourage members to make use of this highly useful tool we’ve reduced the hire rate for the branch’s thermal camera from $10 a day to $10 a week. This winter is ideal for finding out where your heat’s being lost. It’s easy to use - just point, press and the screen shows a saveable thermal image. There’s also a demonstration video. Click <a href="http://community.ata.org.au/flir/">here</a> for details.</p>

<p><strong>Adelaide City Council - Carbon Neutral City: </strong>The ACC invites suggestions that will help it to achieve carbon neutral status and sees ATA members as a great source of practical information. To find out more and give advice see their website <a href="http://www.adelaidecitycouncil.com/city-living/sustainable-adelaide/carbon-neutral-adelaide/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Q&amp;A</strong></p>

<p>ATA meetings put people with questions in touch with people who might have answers. The Q&amp;A session is an open discussion about sustainability topics.</p>

<p>Meetings are open to ATA members and non-members. They aim to be informative and interactive in helping people to learn about living and building sustainability. We look forward to seeing you.</p>
