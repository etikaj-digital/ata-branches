<p><strong>Entry fee:</strong> ATA members $2. Non-members $5. Tea, coffee and biscuits provided.</p>

<p><strong>Presenters</strong>: Oli Scholz and Mark Thomas - architects with Goodhouse</p>

<p>Goodhouse has developed a systematic process for design and construction using a mixture of prefabricated and standard elements.</p>

<p>Many walls are prefabricated using SIPs (structural insulated panels) and delivered to site with doors and windows already fitted. Carbon miles are minimised and components such as SIPs, doors and windows are Adelaide made. Oli and Mark worked at length with the panel manufacturer and their builder to design prefabricated panels and develop construction techniques for quality, thermal efficiency and ease of assembly.</p>

<p>Each house is pressure tested at lock up and assessed with a thermal imaging camera to ensure insulation and air tightness. Systems such as heating and cooling, power generation and hot water are integrated into the design rather than being added afterward. This gives better energy performance and speeds installation. Each home is unique and designed specifically for the site and client. As useful ideas arise they are incorporated into new projects as a form of continual improvement.</p>

<p>Oli and Mark first worked together on the Zero Carbon Challenge to design a ‘zero carbon’ house for under $300,000. Leading their team into the final four, they found they shared the same vision.</p>

<p>Goodhouse focusses on creating true low energy homes at an affordable price and appropriately the company was launched on Sustainable House Day 2012. Two homes have been delivered, a third is almost complete and a further 12 are in progress.</p>

<p>Come along to hear about Goodhouse\'s design and construction system and the challenges that Oli and Mark - and their suppliers - faced as they developed it.<br />

<strong>No April Meeting:</strong> As the third Monday of the month in April is Easter Monday there will be no ATA meeting in April. Our next meeting will be May 19th.<br />

<b>Q&amp;A session</b></p>

<p>ATA meetings put people with questions in touch with people who might have answers. The Q&amp;A session after the main presentation is an open discussion about sustainability topics. For example:</p>

<p>Who can help with an issue?<br />

What\'s on in other parts of Adelaide, SA and Australia?<br />

Any events you\'ve been to and what you\'ve learned.<br />

What presentations or field trips would you like?<br />

We look forward to seeing you at the meeting.</p>
