<p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Ollie Clark AM, Chairman of <a href="http://www.muradel.com">Muradel</a> Pty Ltd.<br />

<em>Ollie has a long and illustrious career in Australia’s energy sector, including as inaugural Managing Director of Envestra Pty Ltd. Over the last decade, Ollie has chaired two companies, SQC Pty Ltd and Muradel Pty Ltd, working on the production of “green” crude oil from microalgae.</em></p>

<p>Muradel originated from a joint research project between Murdoch University, Adelaide University and SQC Pty Ltd. This aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of producing biofuel feedstock from marine microalgae.</p>

<p>Research included determining how the ingredients needed for growing algae - carbon dioxide, nitrogen, phosphorous and water – could be recycled from as many sources as possible. It would also ensure the green crude derived from algae would be suitable for processing in existing oil refineries into traditional liquid fuels.</p>

<p>The process was developed at a pilot plant at Karratha WA. A demonstration plant has been commissioned at Whyalla SA.</p>

<p>Production uses sustainable and energy efficient technologies:</p>

<ul>

<li>Energy efficiency is built into every step of the process, from the pond design to the pump selection, to extraction techniques.</li>

<li>Algae are grown in open raceway ponds using seawater. This avoids using costly freshwater and allows natural management of contaminating microorganisms.</li>

<li>Low energy continuous flocculation and concentration processes create a concentrated product that is suitable for direct treatment into biofuels.</li>

<li>Nutrients are recycled to minimise waste as well as reducing cost.</li>

<li>Power consumption is continuously monitored and calculated to ensure a net positive energy balance.</li>

</ul>

<p>Come along to hear about the latest developments in this fascinating technology.</p>

<p><strong>Q&amp;A session</strong></p>

<p>ATA meetings put people with questions in touch with people who might have answers. The Q&amp;A session is an open discussion about sustainability topics.</p>

<p>Meetings are open to everyone and regularly attract 50 to 60 attendees. They aim to be informative and interactive in helping people to learn about living and building sustainability. We look forward to seeing you.</p>
