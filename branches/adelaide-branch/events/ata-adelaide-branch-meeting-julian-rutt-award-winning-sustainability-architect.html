<p class="BodyText1"><b>Presentation</b></p>

<p class="BodyText1">Julian Rutt is an architect who’s had a long interest in sustainable design. Having been able to work on residential design, recently he hadt the chance to put many of his ideas to the test in the design of his own family\'s home and another for a family member. Literally dozens of design considerations were employed to reduce both operational energy and water used onsite as well as reducing offsite impacts through the manufacture of materials and their construction. Monitored energy and water consumption are both nearly 70% lower than similar sized houses.</p>

<p class="BodyText1">Critically, he didn’t want it to look like an \'eco-house\', preferring instead for the sustainability features to be completely integrated and invisible, in order to appeal to as many people as possible (while still giving his own little twists of architectural whimsy and delight).</p>

<p class="BodyText1">Featured in Sanctuary magazine number 29, the ‘Billabong Houses’ received the Adelaide Review People’s Choice Award for New Housing and a Commendation for Sustainable Architecture at the 2014 SA Australian Institute of Architects Awards.</p>

<p class="Bodytextbold"><strong>Q&amp;A</strong></p>
