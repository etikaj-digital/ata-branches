<p><strong>Presentation</strong>: African Solar Taxi, Trev and Electric Cargo Bikes</p>

<p><em>Andrew Dickson</em> and <em>Dr Peter Pudney</em> formed Team Trev in 2010 to upgrade Trev (Two seater Renewable Energy Vehicle, designed and built by UniSA) and race around the world in the Zero Race. Trev drove 28,000km in 80 days using just $400 of electricity.</p>

<p>Team Trev\'s latest project is the African Solar Taxi (<a href="http://www.africansolartaxi.com">www.africansolartaxi.com</a>), which will transport pregnant women to hospital in rural Zimbabwe. The electric Taxis will be charged from a PV array on the hospital roof and will be true zero emission vehicles. Andrew travelled to Zimbabwe in February 2013 to talk with the intended operators to ensure the taxis will suit their intended purpose. He also inspected the local roads to ensure they\'ll be sufficiently robust.</p>

<p>Peter and Andrew have long interests in renewable energy and zero emission transport. Peter has designed, built and raced numerous solar racing cars in the World Solar Challenge. Andrew was a renewable energy project developer, with projects including the Snowtown Wind Farm and the Solar Dawn solar thermal project in Queensland.</p>

<p>Andrew and Peter both ride electrically assisted bikes, and Andrew rides and sells cargo bikes through <a href="http://www.cargocycles.com.au" target="_blank">Cargo Cycles</a>.</p>

<p>Trev and an electric cargo bike will be available for inspection after the presentation.</p>

<p><b>Q&amp;A session</b></p>

<p>ATA meetings put people with questions in touch with people who might have answers. The Q&amp;A session is an open discussion about sustainability topics. For example:</p>

<ul>

<li>Who can help with an issue?</li>

<li>Events - what\'s coming and what you\'ve been to.</li>

<li>What presentations or field trips would you like?</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Election of Branch Officers</b></p>

<p>All positions will be declared vacant and elections of the Adelaide Branch Convenor, Treasurer and Committee will be held.</p>

<p><b>Coming Up: Feb 17 meeting</b></p>

<p>Water Sensitive Urban Design - advances in on-site water capture, storage &amp; reuse by Professor Simon Beecham, Head of the School of Natural &amp; Built Environments, UniSA.</p>

<p>The minutes of the meeting are available <a href="http://community.ata.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Adelaide-minutes-Jan-2014.doc" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
