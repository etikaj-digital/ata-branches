<p><strong>Presentation: </strong>Mark and Jeremy will overview the activities of Sustainability House\'s design arm \'SuHo Studio\', especially their experiences with <strong>structural insulated panels</strong> (SIPs).</p>

<p>SuHo designed, modelled and built a home to compare performance of energy efficient buildings with traditional builds. They used SIPs to improve thermal comfort and to simplify and speed construction. The presentation will cover the journey from design to occupation plus testing and performance evaluation. It will discuss the pros and cons of SIPs, what went well and what lessons were learned. Mark has a background in building design and energy modelling with experience in using SIPs and other construction materials. Jeremy is an Urban Planner with an interest in sustainable communities and affordability. He helps builders to improve sustainability and understand legislative requirements.</p>
