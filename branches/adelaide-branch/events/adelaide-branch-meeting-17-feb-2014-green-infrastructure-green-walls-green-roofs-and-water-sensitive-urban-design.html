<p><em><strong>\'There\'s No Such Thing as Rubbish\' </strong></em>This excellent booklet explains how a wide range of items can be recycled in South Australia and can be downloaded free via the ATA Adelaide Branch <a href="http://community.ata.org.au/branches/adelaide-branch" target="_blank">web page</a>. It was developed by Sustainable Communities and is reproduced with their permission.</p>

<p><strong>Other Events</strong> - Solar Citizens Is a community project that aims to put a panel on every rooftop and manage concerns of solar owners. An introductory meeting will be held on Monday 17 February 2014. Contact Taegen Edwards, taegen@solarcitizens.org.au or 0438787026.</p>

<p><strong>Q&amp;A session</strong></p>

<p>ATA meetings put people with questions in touch with people who might have answers. The Q&amp;A session after the main presentation is an open discussion about sustainability topics. For example:</p>

<ul>

<li>Who can help with an issue?</li>

<li>What\'s on in other parts of Adelaide, SA and Australia?</li>

<li>Any events you\'ve been to and what you\'ve learned.</li>

<li>What presentations or field trips would you\'d like?</li>

</ul>

<p>We look forward to seeing you at the meeting.</p>
