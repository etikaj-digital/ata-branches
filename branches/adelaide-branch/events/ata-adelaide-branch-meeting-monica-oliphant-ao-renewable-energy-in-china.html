<p><strong>Wind monitoring instruments</strong></p>

<p>The branch has a number of anemometers (Windsensor P2546A) and wind vanes (Vector Instruments W200P) that are available to members for a donation of $5 each. They are professional quality instruments but in used condition and for accurate measurement would require calibration. See the web for details. They don\'t have interface electronics and anemometers require a plug and cable. They will be available for inspection at our June meeting.</p>
