        <p><strong>When</strong>: Monday 21 November 2016,  7.30pm sharp</p>

<p><strong>Where</strong>: Goodwood Community Centre (Banquet Hall), 32 Rosa St, Goodwood SA. The centre is convenient to the tram, buses and train. Enter the car park via Florence St.</p>

<p><strong>Cost</strong>: ATA members $2. Non-members $5, tea, coffee and biscuits provided.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation: </strong>Jenny &amp; Bevan Bates and Nick &amp; Hannah Thwaites.</p>

<p>Vertical Gardens are ‘in’ and can be a great way to add plants to small spaces and provide natural cooling inside and out. Come and learn about the benefits and the things you have to consider in planning your vertical garden.</p>

<p>Jenny and Bevan Bates live at Lochiel Park Green Village and have installed several vertical gardens in their courtyard, while Nick and Hannah Thwaites run The Productive Garden Co and have installed numerous vertical gardens around Adelaide as part of their business. Nick recently visited some interstate gardens to check out how they are going. They’ll also talk about a local roof garden experiment that might give you some ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Q&amp;A</strong></p>

<p>ATA meetings put people with questions in touch with people who might have answers. The Q&amp;A session is an open discussion about sustainability topics.</p>

<p>Meetings are open to ATA members and non-members. They aim to be informative and interactive in helping people to learn about living and building sustainability. We look forward to seeing you.</p>

<p><strong>Next meeting</strong></p>

<p>There will be no meeting in December or January – look out for the newsletter for the date and details of our next meeting.</p>

<p>As always, the Committee invites suggestions for presentations and feedback regarding what they want from ATA meetings - send to <a href="mailto:adelaidebranch@ata.org.au">adelaidebranch@ata.org.au</a>.</p>
