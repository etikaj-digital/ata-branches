<p><strong>Presentation: </strong></p>

<p class="BodyText1">Dean Spaccavento has considerable technical expertise in the Australian, North American and Asia Pacific electrical supply industries. He\'ll explain how households enabled by energy storage and a world-first business model can participate in the energy market and earn money from it.</p>

<p class="BodyText1">South Australia enjoys a high penetration of solar energy but electricity consumers pay high electricity prices by world standards. SA also has a volatile energy market and retailing companies pay very high \'spot\' prices to generators when demand is high.  These occurrences make the combination of solar generation, energy storage and intelligent control a more attractive prospect for SA than anywhere else.</p>

<p class="BodyText1">Reposit Power\'s GridCredits technology enables consumers to do things previously only energy utilities could do. The software allows householders to trade on the energy market and essentially \'buy low and sell high\'. Using parameters such as the home\'s energy consumption habits, weather, grid demand and future energy prices, the software automatically decides whether it\'s advantageous for a system to store the solar energy or sell to the grid, allowing the household to profit. This significantly reduces the payback time for energy storage. Owners benefit from the price volatility in the grid and help improve the grid stability whilst encouraging the uptake of renewables.</p>
