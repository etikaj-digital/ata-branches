<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>

<p>In June 2014, Adelaide Branch Committee members John and Cathryn described how they designed and built their energy efficient home at Gilberton. They moved in Oct 2013 and have been monitoring performance in terms of energy and water consumption and electricity generation - as well as comfort in terms of temperature and humidity.</p>

<p>They\'ll describe how they operate the house in each season, how they shade west facing windows and features of the house such as thermal mass. They\'ll also explain what they\'d do differently if doing it again.</p>

<p><strong>Election of officers</strong></p>

<p>An election of the positions of Adelaide Branch Convenor, Treasurer and Committee will be held in early 2016. Nominations for these positions are invited and anyone who\'s keen to help develop the branch is encouraged. To nominate or for information contact <a href="mailto:adelaidebranch@ata.org.au">adelaidebranch@ata.org.au</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Q&amp;A</strong></p>

<p>ATA meetings put people with questions in touch with people who might have answers. The Q&amp;A session is an open discussion about sustainability topics.</p>

<p>Meetings are open to ATA members and non-members. They aim to be informative and interactive in helping people to learn about living and building sustainability. We look forward to seeing you.</p>
