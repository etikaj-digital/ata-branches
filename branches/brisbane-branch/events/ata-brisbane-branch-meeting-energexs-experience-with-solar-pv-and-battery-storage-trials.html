<p><strong>Presentation:</strong></p>

<p>South East Queensland has one of the highest penetrations of solar PV systems in the world, and this looks set to increase as more and more customers embrace renewable energy alternatives for their homes and businesses. Given its high solar PV penetration, Queensland has been earmarked as one of the primary target markets by key players in the Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) market. As the uptake of BESS increases, Energex’s systems and processes will continue to evolve to efficiently integrate these new customer technologies into the network.</p>

<p>This talk by Glen Kolpak and colleagues will examine Energex’s experience with solar PV on their network and the work Energex is undertaking in BESS, such as suitable tariff structures and control strategies, to best integrate solar PV and BESS into the distribution network.</p>

<p>Glen Kolpak is currently the Stakeholder Relations Manager for Energex . Prior to this he managed a demand management program administered by Energex, Positive Payback for Business for four years, to reduce the electricity demand across small business in SEQ.  Energex’s demand management programs were successful in eliminating approximately 160 megawatts of peak load across the Energex network in 5 years<strong>.  </strong>Demand management program researched all types of different technologies (including solar) and tariff options to permanently take peak load off the network.</p>
