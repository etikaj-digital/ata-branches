<p>Steve Helleur, from Brisbane based RFI Solar, will give a presentation on the current reality of battery storage for grid connected solar PV. The talk will cover the commonly used battery technologies for both off-grid and grid connected systems, and associated system components. This will be a great follow-up to John Harding’s August talk re innovative hybrid systems.</p>

<p>RFI Solar has been a major distributor of solar PV and associated components since the 1970s, starting out as Bob McKnight Trading in the Valley. Steve Helleur has been part of the Australian PV industry since 1989 in various sales and product roles. He was a member of the sales team at Solarex in the 90’s (one of two Australian PV manufacturers back then), before moving to Canon to promote and sell their triple junction amorphous silicon technology, which was installed at Singleton solar farm (200kW) and on the Sydney Superdome (now Allphones Arena). For the past 13 years he has been with RFI and is the product manager responsible for off-grid and storage products.</p>
