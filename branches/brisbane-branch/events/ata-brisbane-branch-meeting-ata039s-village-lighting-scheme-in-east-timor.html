<p><strong>Presentation: </strong></p>

<p>Since 2003, ATA’s International Projects Group (IPG), mostly volunteers, has been working with East Timorese communities to provide clean, renewable lighting and electricity. ATA has overseen the installation of 1,168 household solar systems in East Timor and over 150 village-based technicians have been trained to install and maintain them.</p>

<p>We are proud to have established a renewable energy national curriculum in East Timor. With funding from AusAID in 2010, ATA developed a curriculum and train-the-trainer material for teaching the installation of small solar photovoltaic systems. The Certificate 2 course is recognised by the East Timorese Government. To date there have been over 230 solar technicians trained across the country, including 42 women.</p>

<p>As a recipient of Google Impact Challenge <a href="https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/australia2014">funding</a> in 2014, ATA has been able to scale up our Village Lighting Scheme (VLS) in East Timor, with the rollout in 2015-16 of 600 additional solar systems and development of a solar projects mapping website. This funding enabled ATA to develop and deploy a prototype home solar system specifically for the context in East Timor, and to enhance our technical monitoring capability through in-built data logging and Wi-Fi functionality.</p>

<p>Winning the 2016 United Nations Association of Australia’s World Environment Day, Clean Energy Award has awarded the ATA increased profile and credibility to develop relationships and future projects with multiple stakeholders, including the Government of East Timor, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Australian Government’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker</strong>: Lisa Weber is the principal consultant at Precision Management Solutions Pty Ltd, a boutique consulting firm specialising in the visual integration of data. Lisa has 20 years of experience in IT disciplines including database, CAD and GIS and also as a trainer. She has worked with numerous organisations to assist with project implementations, training and integration of data and workflows and integrated website creation. She has a strong vision to see sustainable solutions implemented that are good for the planet and the societies that dwell on it, and to use data to inform these decision. Lisa has been an ATA member for many years and has been to East Timor as part of the IPG (International Projects Group) group twice, in 2015 and 2016.</p>

<p>Lisa will be providing insight into the ATA’s IPG project in East Timor, drawing from general knowledge about the project as well as her own personal experiences and discussing the solar projects mapping website that she built to enhance the project’s reach. To view the maps, visit the IPG website <a href="https://www.ata.org.au/ata-solar-projects-in-east-timor">here</a>.</p>

<p>We hope to see you at the meeting.</p>
