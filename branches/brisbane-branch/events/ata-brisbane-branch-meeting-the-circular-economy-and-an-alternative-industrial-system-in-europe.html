<p>This talk will present an alternative to the conventional industrial system – the circular economy. This economy relies far less on conventional mining and far more on reuse and recycling of key material flows. This is evolving, partly because conventional mining is struggling to remain viable.  The productivity of the mining industry has been declining for 17 years.  A case can be made that a change in mining practice and a change in the business model behind mining is coming.Europe has responded to these challenges with a number of initiatives, one of which is the Circular Economy concept.  The EU wishes to become more self-reliant in sourcing its raw material needs.  A series of projects have been funded to develop the necessary tools and strategies to achieve this. How might this work? The proposition that Europe could become a new frontier for mining exploration and development is also presented, with some unconventional challenges.Dr Simon Michaux is a full time Senior Research Officer at the Genie Mineral-Materiaux &amp; Environment department (GeMMe) at University of Liege, in Belgium.  Currently he is working on aspects of industrial recycling in context of the Circular Economy and developing projects around a Selfrag unit.</p>

<p>He obtained a PhD in Mining Engineering (Explosives) from the University of Queensland, a MScEng and a Bachelor of Applied Science in Physics &amp; Geology from Queensland University of Technology.</p>

<p>He worked at the JKMRC for 18 years in a range of capacities and in 2013 joined Ausenco, in the Technical Solutions Division as a geometallurical consultant in support of feasibility studies of process plant construction.</p>
