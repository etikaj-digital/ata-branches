<p><strong>Presentation</strong>:</p>

<p>Geoffrey Chia is a Brisbane Cardiologist/Physician who has studied Peak Oil issues for more than 15 years. This preoccupation arose from an awareness that cardiac health issues, although immensely important to the particular individuals afflicted, pale into insignificance compared with the monumental global population health issues arising from our failure to transition from fossil fuel addiction to a sustainable existence. This situation was forecast more than 40 years ago by the \'Limits to Growth\' scientists and the chickens are now coming home to roost.<br />

Geoffrey devised a <a href="https://cassandralegacy.blogspot.com/2017/12/the-seneca-cliff-explained-as-network.html">3 dimensional model</a> to aid understanding of the dynamic interplay between various components of our unsustainability. Political/economic/military considerations represent just one component.<br />

In this talk he will describe the historical events (focusing on fossil fuel politics) that explain how we have come to arrive at our current situation and he posits the consequences if "the powers that be" fail to take appropriate action.<br />

Following up on previous talks, he will then briefly discuss positive local solutions, such as offgrid permaculture communities in climate resilient locations, using low energy, low power alternative technologies.</p>

<p>We hope to see you there.</p>
