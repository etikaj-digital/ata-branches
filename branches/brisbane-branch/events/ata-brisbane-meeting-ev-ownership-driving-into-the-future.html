<p><strong>EV Ownership: Driving into the future</strong></p>

<p>Janet and Gary Crighton have been ATA members for about three years now. Motivated by the success of their home solar PV system at Cleveland, and a desire to make some small positive contribution to sustainability for the planet, they chose to extend their use of clean energy to transportation with the purchase of a BMWi3 electric car.</p>

<p>Janet has a keen interest in organic gardening and Gary, a former local government employee, is a long time car enthusiast. “At one time a while ago, it dawned on me there were cars in the garage being powered by four different fuel sources. Ahhhh.  The current one naturally has to be the most radical by a long shot, and for its intended purpose the best yet.” says Gary.</p>

<p>The evening talk will examine the pros (mostly) and cons (couple) of EV driving generally, home charging options and running costs, what makes BMW\'s take on mobility so different and finally address questions and concerns.</p>

<p>You can download a copy of Gary\'s presentation <a href="http://community.ata.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Gary-ATA-EV-presentation.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>Kind regards, ATA Brisbane Branch.</p>
