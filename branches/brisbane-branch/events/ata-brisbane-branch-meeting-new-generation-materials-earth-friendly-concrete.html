He works for Wagners, a leading Australian construction materials supplier, managing their “Earth Friendly Concrete”, or EFC, business. EFC is a highly innovative addition to the concrete industry being a low carbon emission and high performance ‘cement free’ concrete based on geopolymer technology. Wagners have successfully brought this technology from infancy to a commercial product that has both Australian and international application. Tom has authored and presented many technical papers on the topic of commercial geopolymer concrete to conferences in Australia, Middle East, New Zealand and Singapore.</p>

<p>Prior to Wagners, Tom has worked with Cement Concrete &amp; Aggregates Australia (CCAA), Boral Masonry and Swan &amp; Kavanaugh Consulting engineers.</p>

<p>Tom is a qualified civil and structural engineer. He has a bachelors degree in civil engineering from Queensland University of Technology (QUT), and a Masters degree in Business and Technology from the University of New South Wales (UNSW). Tom is a registered professional engineer of Queensland (RPEQ) and is registered on the National Engineering Register (NER) of Australia in the categories of Structural, Civil and Leadership and Management.</p>

<p>We hope to see you there.</p>
