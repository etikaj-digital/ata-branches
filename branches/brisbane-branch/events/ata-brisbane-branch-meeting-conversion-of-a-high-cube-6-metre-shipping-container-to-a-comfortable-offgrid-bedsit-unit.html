<p><strong>Presentation</strong>: This ongoing project involves the conversion of a "high cube" 20 foot long shipping container to a comfortable off-grid bedsit unit. The very basic design was by Dr Geoffrey Chia and the majority of the conversion work was done by architectural graduate and carpenter Lara Nobel. The talk will cover design features, including 12V electrics and solar hot water system with Q and A about practical and technical conversion aspects. The talk will also comment on council policies and transport details of the container to final site. This project is an example of a practical solution to affordable housing within the capability of any DIY enthusiast, much simpler than a tiny house build.</p>

<p>Dr Geoffrey Chia is one of few professionals around the world who are concerned over the limits to growth of the human population, and the associated unsustainability of the current economic system that promotes endless growth of population, resource consumption and associated waste and pollution. He convenes the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/The-Limits-to-Growth-Action-Group/">Limits to Growth Action Group</a> in Brisbane and has written extensively on this topic.</p>

<p>Lara Nobel is an architectural graduate and carpenter and will answer technical build related questions</p>

<p>We hope to see you there.</p>
