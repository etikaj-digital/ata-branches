<div><strong>Presentation:</strong></div>

<div>For over 15 years John Tennock and his wife Anne have been exploring possible responses to the global threats of climate change, peak oil and gas, and financial instability. In 2003 the opportunity arose to join Goolawah Cooperative, a new off-grid rural land-sharing eco-commmunity in NSW. It was not to be missed! Since then they have been actively involved in the growth and development of the community including the inevitable trials and tribulations, and learning about the many alternative technologies, from composting toilets to governance structures, that are essential for an independent community to grow to healthy maturity.</p>

<p>With a lifetime career in electronics and IT, often in sole-charge remote locations, John has considerable experience in the practical implementation and trouble-shooting of complex technical systems. This has ranged from large government and corporate installations to small business and non-profit enterprises. John is retired and currently serves as treasurer for Goolawah Cooperative Ltd among other volunteer roles.</p></div>
