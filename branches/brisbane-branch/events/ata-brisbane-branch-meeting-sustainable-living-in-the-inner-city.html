<p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Roman SPUR as a sustainable design engineer lives what he preaches. He transforms an inner city rented property into a productive food source and living sustainably in complete happiness. You could see him on the ABC TV\'s Gardening Australia, Courier Mail or presentations and workshops. Roman passionately shares his knowledge, experience, ideas and inventions. His sustainable living story and working towards self-sufficiency (growing food, making home produce, up-cycling materials, using urban environment to his benefit and living in a small functional community) make his family less reliant on the society. He created SpurTopia – \'A Small Kingdom of Happiness\'</p>

<p>Be inspired by guest speaker Roman SPUR who transforms an inner city rented property into a productive food source and living sustainably in complete happiness. You could see him on the ABC TV\'s Gardening Australia, Courier Mail or presentations and workshops.<br />

Roman and his family will share how working towards self-sufficiency (growing food, making home produce, up-cycling materials, using urban environment to their benefit and living in a small functional community) make his family less reliant on the society.<br />

There will be plenty of ideas and inventions to show (self-watering planter boxes, homemade laundry Detergent and citrus softener, Solar hot water system made from recycled materials for less than $50 etc.) so be inspired to take the first step - create your own Utopia. For more details about Roman’s work see his <a href="http://spurtopia.blogspot.com.au">website</a>.</p>
