<p><strong>Presentation</strong>: Passive House Design: Health And Energy Impacts</p>

<p><a href="http://www.envirotecture.com.au">Envirotecture</a> has a track record in sustainable design including zero carbon emission homes and 9-star energy-efficiency. The company has over 35 years\' experience and has received numerous design, sustainability and community awards.</p>

<p>Andy Marlow is an Architecture graduate of UNSW. He regularly teaches there and at UTS in the sustainable design and building ecology courses. Prior to his current position, Andy was National Sustainability Manager at Cox Architects when he undertook the arduous Living Building Challenge of UoW\'s Sustainable Buildings Research Centre (<a href="https://sbrc.uow.edu.au/index.html">SBRC</a>). He received a travelling scholarship for research on engaging communities and has been a passionate community educator, running sustainable renovation workshops for Sydney Councils.</p>

<p>Andy is a Certified Passive House Designer and Director of the Australian Passive House Association. He jokes that such houses have been derided as "ugly boxes with closed windows" by some who would be more thermally comfortable in a tent than their existing home. Current homes do leak like sieves so they need to be over-insulated to offset that. Passive House principles, including the Step-by-Step retrofit tool, are ways of providing superior indoor comfort and air quality while reducing energy use and carbon emissions.</p>

<p>Members and visitors are welcome.</p>
