<strong>Presentation: </strong>Prof. Vasallo will present an update on the status of energy storage, solar PV and electric vehicles, and how their uptake will affect electric power systems in Australia and globally. He will also discuss how these devices might interact, and the challenges and benefits of this. Tony will also show some hardware and on-line resources that are easy to follow relating to the "Internet of energy things" and will discuss some recent research on the benefits of community renewable energy networks.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker bio:</strong> Professor Anthony Vassallo holds the Delta Electricity Chair in Sustainable Energy Development at the University of Sydney. Prior to this, he was Senior Principal Research Scientist with the CSIRO, followed by a period of consultancy to industry and government in the field of sustainable energy technology. Tony\'s interest in energy storage started in 1993 when he realised that high surface area carbons were ideal for electrochemical energy storage. He then conceived the CSIRO Carbon Supercapacitor Project which led to the formation of Cap-XX Pty Ltd, an Australian start-up company.  Tony has been recognised with the CSIRO Chairman\'s Medal for the Low Emissions Vehicle Team. He also shared the CSIRO Medal for Research Achievement in 2004 for the High Power Supercapacitor Team. Tony is a passionate advocate of the need to transition to low carbon energy sources, and in particular, the development of battery energy storage to facilitate very high levels of renewable generation. Current postgraduate projects include: Energy Storage Systems in Australian Smart Grids; Optimisation of Battery Storage with PV Systems and Community Renewable Energy Networks. Tony is a past President of the Australian Institute of Energy, Director of the Centre for Sustainable Energy Development and led the multi-university Future Grid Research Cluster, sponsored by the CSIRO.</p>
