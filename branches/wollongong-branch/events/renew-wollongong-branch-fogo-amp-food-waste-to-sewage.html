<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b></b>At the next meeting of Renew’s Wollongong Branch we will have four exciting speakers on Food Organics Garden Organics (FOGO) and a new Sydney Water/UOW project to add food waste to sewage.</p>

<p>In July 2016, Shellharbour City Council introduced its kerbside FOGO collection service. This involved upgrading the collection system, community behavioural change and construction of an in-tunnel composting facility at Dunmore. Managed by Re.Group, this currently accepts kerbside collected FOGO along with public drop-off garden material. The composting process turns this into high-end soil conditioner.</p>

<p><strong>Courtney Williams</strong> is the Team Leader – Waste Management at Shellharbour City Council. She has driven Council’s Waste Strategy for ten years, including the FOGO service and processing facility.</p>

<p><strong>Pat Keating</strong> is the General Manger of Organics for the large Re.Group, including the FOGO facility at Dunmore He has managed energy from waste facilities, anaerobic and aerobic digestion plants, and facilities like Dunmore across both Australia and Asia.<br />

Together, Courtney and Pat will cover the process from a good idea to a delivered solution, with a focus on the technology aspects.</p>

<hr />

<p>Sydney Water and the University of Wollongong are collaborating on an innovative project to add food waste including beer, wine and soft drink streams to sewage. Co- digestion at the Shellharbour Wastewater Treatment Plant provides additional biogas and green energy.</p>

<p><strong>Phil Woods</strong> leads Service Planning (Energy), developing strategies and programs to help make Sydney Water an international leader in energy management and renewable energy from waste. His Energy Master Plan sets the vision and goals to turn Sydney Water from a major energy user to an energy generator and a key player in the management of organic waste.<br />

<strong>Dr Heriberto (Heri) Bustamante</strong>  is Principal Scientist, Treatment in the Business Strategy and Resilience Division of Sydney Water. He identifies research needs and partners to deliver project outcomes that can be adopted. Heri has contributed to the water/wastewater, petrochemical, mineral and coal industries in Australia and England.</p>

<p>Members and visitors are welcome.</p>
