<p><strong>Speaker</strong>: Sandra Dohring Business Development Manager, Sims Recycling Solutions.</p>

<p>Sandra graduated from Sydney’s UTS with MBus in strategic supply chain and operations management. She helps business recycle their electronic waste in an ethical way while protecting their sensitive data. She grew up on Réunion Island where she developed its WEEE (Waste Electrical &amp; Electronic Equipment) recycling platform and other sustainability initiatives.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation</strong>: Australians are amongst the world’s highest users of technology. 17 million televisions and 37 million computers were sent to Australian landfills up to 2008. Such e-Waste can be both toxic and valuable, for example IT hardware has much more gold and precious metals than is currently mined from the ground. Urban “mining” and recycling e-Waste to the highest possible levels is critical. Sims Recycling Solutions is a division of Sims Metal Management, the world’s leading publicly-listed metals and electronics recycler. Sandra also interacts with the marine environment.</p>

<p>Having learned free-diving off Réunion from her father she has started a free-diving group here. She helps organise ocean clean-up events with UOW’s Surfrider Club. Photo shows her removing fishing line and lures along with plastic bags, bottles, cans, straws and other rubbish from Wollongong harbour.</p>
