<p><strong>Speaker</strong>: <strong>Touie Smith, Thermal Heating and Cooling Australia</strong></p>

<p>Touie is the third generation in his family to work in refrigeration and air conditioning (also an electrician) and has been working in the building industry for 20 years.<br />

THCA is involved in conventional HVAC installation, as well as specific work focussing on renewable energy applications, in a roughly 50/50 mix.<br />

In his own words, his interest in renewables began "when I was an apprentice, we were looking after a supermarket when my father (who was my boss at the time) suggested we use a de-superheater tank to capture the waste heat coming off the refrigeration racks. We were able to give the supermarket butcher endless free hot water that would otherwise be complete waste heat. It got me interested in energy capture.”</p>

<p><strong>Presentation: </strong></p>

<p>If you have ever been attracted to the idea of radiant heating, wondered about how hydronic heating really works or been curious about the application of ground-source heat pumps and geothermal energy for residential use, this will be the meeting for you. Touie Smith, from Thermal Heating and Cooling Australia will be speaking about all things radiant and renewable in heating and cooling. Their main focus as a company is high end heat pumps, either ground sourced or air sourced. By coupling these to solar systems they aim for lowest possible input. They work closely with solar companies and currently have a number of off grid projects. Touie will be discussing some of their recent projects and showing slides of installations. A time for Q and A will be held after the talk as usual.</p>

<p>This is a public meeting: please invite anyone who might be interested.</p>
