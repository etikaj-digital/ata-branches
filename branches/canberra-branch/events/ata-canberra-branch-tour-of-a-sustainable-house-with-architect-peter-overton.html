<p><strong>Event details: </strong>Local ATA member, Isobel has offered to show her dual occupancy project to any interested ATA members. This tour cannot wait until Solar House Day or Sustainable House Day because the houses will be rented out very soon.</p>

<p>Instead, she is happy to host an early evening event for ATA members to look over the houses. <a href="http://www.ttarchitecture.com.au">Peter Overton</a>, the architect on the project, will give a short overview on how the houses work.</p>

<p>Here are some background points on the houses;</p>

<ul>

<li>The old house is Isobel’s childhood residence and her parents lived in it until about 10 years back. It was rented for a few years, and she decided to up-grade the house and add a new residence as a dual occupancy. It has only just been completed, but the landscape is already mature and siteworks done, so it is easy to visit.</li>

<li>The old house is a traditional cavity brick structure from the 1950’s, which has been up-graded with retro-fitted insulation to floors, walls and ceiling, a new steel roof, new Miglas double-glazed composite frame windows, and some small-scale additions and re-zoning to improve sun access to the living area. Even though it is oriented at almost 45deg west of north, the house had sufficient quality in the structure to make it worth retaining. It also had a lot of memory value.</li>

<li>The new house is a light-weight, two-storey structure, done in more of a passivhaus method. It is about 140 sq.m. in area, and uses Intello membranes to air-seal the whole structure. The same Miglas windows are used, and it also employs Bio PCM phase-change insulating matts to add thermal interia over and above that supplied by the concrete floor. It is physically attached to the old house through a party wall, but is cranked around to give a true north orientation. It uses Lumos HRV units to achieve the required active ventilation, and also uses heat pump A/C units for back-up heating/cooling and Sanden heat-pump water heaters. Each house has a small 2kW Winaico PV system mounted on the north pitch of the roofs.</li>

<li>40kL rainwater tank serves both houses.</li>

<li>A registered red-gum tree dominates the site – canopy covers approximately 35% of the site area. Many of the design and siting decisions were determined by the tree preservation issues.</li>

</ul>

<div>This will be a fascinating tour and a great opportunity to see a successful and sustainable project.</div>
