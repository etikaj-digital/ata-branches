<p><strong> Subject: </strong>Developments in technologies and modelling for sustainable housing.<br />

The Alternative Technology Association is holding its <a href="http://sustainablehouseday.com">Sustainable House Day</a> on the 17th of September. This is a great opportunity to explore how people in our region have approached the challenge of producing a sustainable home.<br />

In this meeting experts from within the local ATA branch will discuss interesting new developments in the design and construction of more sustainable and more comfortable housing.</p>

<ul>

<li>Peter Overton (TT architecture) will present a show and tell, including some test data, on the subject of new building products which have relevance to passive solar housing. For example, vacuum panel insulation and BioPCM phase change insulation. He will also discuss load shifting and load management as an approach to “battery free” energy storage.</li>

<li>Peter Lyons will describe the recently development energy rating scheme for window coverings (WincovER), with particular focus on honeycomb blinds. Peter was part of the team that developed this scheme.</li>

<li>Jeff Knowles will give an overview of the sustainable house day event and introduce some of the owners of the houses that will be open for exploration.</li>

</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Speaker details:</strong></p>
