<p><strong>Real life battery performance:</strong> Fraser has had a PV system and two Tesla powerwall (1) batteries running together for over a year. The batteries are controlled using the Reposit monitoring and control application. Fraser will talk about and illustrate the performance of the system, demonstrate the use of the software and happily answer any questions.</p>

<p>Fraser Argue has incrementally worked on improving the sustainability of the houses he has lived in over nearly 50 years. The most progress has been on his Canberra home using a range of technologies over the last 31 years. He retired from ActewAGL Distribution after a 40+ year career as an electrical power engineer in Canberra and NZ, and as a consequence has a strong understanding of the electrical systems in the ACT and beyond.</p>

<p><strong>Modelling with the ATA Sunulator:</strong> Last year Andrew\'s household acquired a second-hand EV and swapped from gas to electrical heat-pumps for heating. This radically changed the balance between household consumption and production from the modest PV system. Can (and should) we panel/battery our way out of the problem?<br />

The ATA provides a very useful tool that can help to answer these questions by providing a detailed model of the energy and financial flows of a proposed system. In this part of the meeting some of the extensive features of the <a href="http://www.ata.org.au/ata-research/sunulator">Sunulator</a> tool developed at the ATA by Andrew Reddaway will be demonstrated. A streamlined web-based version of the tool will be available shortly.</p>

<p>Andrew Perry is the secretary of the Canberra branch of the ATA.</p>
