<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Ben Elliston</p>

<p>Ben Elliston is a senior consultant at IT Power (Australia).</p>

<p>After stints as a software engineer he went on to work towards a PhD at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). In this study he developed a simulation that modeled 100% renewable energy in the Australian national electricity market. He then went to work for the Centre for Energy and Environmental Markets, UNSW before joining IT Power.</p>

<p><strong>Subject</strong>: One path to an all-electric home.</p>

<p>In this talk, Ben will present an 8 year chronology of converting his household from predominantly gas fuelled (aka "dual fuel") to one using no gas.</p>

<p>Recent issues of ReNew magazine illustrate the trend towards all-electric households. The general idea is that it\'s easy to generate or buy renewable electricity, but much harder to generate or buy renewable gas. This is especially true in the ACT, where by 2020 a household will be able to decarbonise its energy supply, but not if it uses gas. The sharply rising cost of gas has also captured the attention of households.</p>

<p>Ben will discuss how his household patiently converted our appliances from gas to electric (including all of the mistakes made!) and what he learned along the way. Importantly, Ben will show just how much more energy efficient all-electric households can be than dual fuel ones.</p>
