<p><strong>Presentation</strong>: Ginninderry – Building a Sustainable Community</p>

<div>

<p class="x_ydp5e9a6e76yiv0969020099MsoNormal">A decade in the making, Ginninderry is a 6 Star Green Star community near Belconnen in the ACT that is redefining sustainable living. It is a 30 to 40 year project which will ultimately be home for approximately 30,000 residents. Ginninderry is Australia\'s only cross-border master-planned community – extending across the ACT border into NSW.<br />

Hear from Ginninderry Sustainability Manager, Jessica Stewart, on how the community has managed to encompass affordability, nature conservation and environmental urban design to demonstrate global best practice.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Jessica Stewart is currently the Sustainability Manager for Riverview Projects. She studied Engineering and Science at the ANU, majoring in mechanics, renewable energy systems, sustainable science and science communication.<br />

Prior to starting with Riverview, Jessica had five years experience with the ACT Government\'s Land Development Agency in their Sustainability and Innovation section and as an Energy Auditor throughout the ACT and regional New South Wales.<br />

Jessica has a passion for building strong, resilient communities and exploring the reasons why people love (and hate) the places in which they live, work and play. Through education and energy efficiency, Jess aims to raise the bar for new developments and Ginninderry in particular, by ensuring that residents maximise their assets, reduce their running costs and design smarter homes. In 2017 Jessica was awarded the National Association of Women in Construction ACT Emerging Leader Award and was named the Property Council of Australia\'s ACT Future Leader of the Year.</p>
