<p><strong>Presentations: </strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Fraser Argue: Wicking beds for easier backyard gardening</li>

<li>Peter Abbott: The importance of Native Bees</li>

<li>Jeff Knowles: Batteries with your solar PV</li>

</ul>

<p>This month we are going to start by hearing about sustainability in the garden.<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif"> </span><span style="color: #26282a">Fraser will show how wicking beds can be readily made in all shapes and sizes. They can be raised to make it harder for pests and weeds to invade and make gardening easier on your back.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #26282a">Wicking beds are very productive, save water, and they stretch the intervals between watering. Fraser hopes to have others with wicking bed experience at the meeting to help answer any challenging questions.</span></p>

<p>Our native flora as well as food plants require pollination to survive - Peter will introduce you to our native bees and their role in sustaining our flora and assisting with crop pollination. Many solitary native bees live in our region – we need to encourage them to take up residence in our gardens.</p>

<p>Finally we step back inside with Jeff who has been evaluating a home battery storage system at his place. Anyone considering installing a battery storage system will benefit from what he has learned.</p>

<p><b>Fraser Argue</b> is retired electrical engineer with a passionate interest in sustainability. He is a committee member of the local branch of Renew.</p>

<p><b>Peter Abbott</b> is an experienced apiarist - honeybees first, now stingless social native bees. He is now focussing on the many species of solitary native bees.</p>

<p><b>Jeff Knowles</b> is a teacher of philosophy but also an early adopter of PV and battery technology. He has been convenor of the Canberra Branch of Renew and is still an active member of the local committee.</p>

<p>This is a public meeting; please invite anyone who might be interested.</p>
