        <p><strong>When</strong>: Wednesday 28 October, 2015, 7:30 pm<br />

<strong>Where</strong>: Ian Ross Building, Australian National University</p>

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> A double header to bring us up-to-date on what is happening internationally in building (energy) design and modelling and the important climate and weather data that is required as input to these models and in many other applications – insurance risk assessment for example!</p>

<p>Peter attended this year\'s Summer Meeting of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) in Atlanta, Georgia. He will discuss current and planned research projects being undertaken by ASHRAE members especially in fenestration (window design and performance), building envelope energy performance and human thermal comfort.</p>

<p>Trevor attended the 3<sup>rd</sup> International Conference on Energy and Meteorology (Boulder, Colorado) which gathers together people involved in research and applications at the intersection between weather, climate and energy. At this meeting the World Energy and Meteorology Council was formed and its inaugural head is a scientist from CSIRO in Canberra.</p>

<p>Trevor will describe the highlights of the meeting and also present a version of the joint paper that he delivered there: "Comparison of Satellite Estimated Hourly Solar Data with Coincident Ground Based Measurements and their Applications in Industry and Commerce".</p>

<p><strong>Bio: Peter Lyons</strong> is the convenor of the Canberra branch of the ATA. He is Principal of Peter Lyons &amp; Associates. and a joint founder of DesignBuilder Software Australia. He is a building physicist who has specialised in energy performance of windows and glass for over 20 years and is a one of the original developers of the Window Energy Rating Scheme (WERS).</p>

<p><strong>Bio: Trevor Lee</strong> is the Director of Buildings with Exemplary Energy Partners based in Kingston ACT and a provider of specialised weather and climate data and simulation services to the building and renewable energy industries (<a href="http://www.exemplary.com.au/">www.exemplary.com.au</a>).</p>
