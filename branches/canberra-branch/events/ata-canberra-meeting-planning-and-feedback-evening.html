<p>This is the first meeting for 2017 of the Canberra Branch of the Alternative Technology Association and the committee would like to hear from you about the subjects you would like to have discussed during the coming year. In the coming months we are planning presentations and discussions on renewing the electricity network, improved PV technology, sustainable housing and electric vehicles, amongst others. What would you like to see or change? Please bring along your ideas and suggestions.</p>

<p>We also want to be able to represent your interests at the ATA branch strategy and training meeting being held in Melbourne on the following weekend, which will bring together representative from ATA branches all around Australia. Please come along on Wednesday and tell us what you believe should be the highest priorites for the ATA in the next decade, so that we can take this to the national meeting.</p>

<p>This is a public meeting: please invite anyone who might be interested. We hope to see you at the meeting.</p>

<p>Regards,<br />

Andrew.</p>

<p>Andrew Perry<br />

Secretary, ATA Canberra Branch<br />
