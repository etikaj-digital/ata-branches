<strong>When</strong>: Wednesday 30 November, 2016, 7:00 pm (Annual Meeting). 7:45 pm (BZE presentation)<br />

<strong>Where</strong>: Ian Ross Building, Australian National University, 31 North Road, Acton ACT 2601</p>

<p><strong>This meeting will also be our annual general meeting at which we need to elect new members of the committee that keeps this branch running. If you would like to see the work of the ATA continue in Canberra and be able to enjoy the wide range talks on offer please consider joining the committee. It does not involve much time.</p>

<p></strong><strong>Speakers</strong>: Jodie Green and Mark Spain. Beyond Zero Emissions.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation</strong>: Ten-year pathways to a zero-carbon, innovative Australia - the Zero Carbon Australia project.Since 2006 Beyond Zero Emissions (BZE) has produced carefully researched reports that layout the steps by which we could de-carbonise each of 6 key sectors of the Australian economy in 10 years and which together all form the acclaimed Zero Carbon Australia project</span>. The latest report, on electric vehicles powered by 100% renewable energy, was released in August this year. The next series of reports, on decarbonising industrial processes, will be BZEs final sector-specific research plan. These reports provide a powerful antidote to the "that would never work" opposition that is so prevalent in discussions of Australia\'s future paths.</p>

<p>Following on from an overview of the Zero Carbon Australia project  Jodie and Mark will  invite a group discussion. They\'re both interested in obtaining insights into ways the combination of BZEs big picture research and all of our individual actions potentially breath life into an effective system-wide transition of the sort that is needed.</p>

<p>Jodie Green handles communications and media for BZE and has an interest in climate solutions pedagogy especially for young people. Mark Spain is a senior partner and facilitator in Global Learning Pty. Ltd., a volunteer in a range of regional sustainability projects and a long term member of BZEs national presenter team.</p>

<p>This is a public meeting: please invite anyone who might be interested.</p>

<p>We hope to see you at the meeting.</p>

<p>Regards, ATA Canberra branch<br />
