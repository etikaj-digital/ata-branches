<p><strong>Speaker</strong>: Dr Hugh Saddler is an independent consultant who has spent almost all of his professional life working on issues related to energy and environmental policy. This has been as an academic, government employee, and consultant. He is the author of a book on Australian energy policy and over 70 scientific papers, monographs, and articles. He is a regular media commentator on energy and climate change policy and the author of a monthly newsletter, called <a href="http://www.tai.org.au/publication/national-energy-emissions-audit">The National Energy Emissions Audit</a>, that tracks and reports on trends in Australian energy supply, consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation: </strong>Adding wind and solar sources to the electricity system. Does it really break things?</p>

<p>In this talk Dr. Saddler will present an overview of today\'s South Australian electricity system and the changes which have resulted from adding wind and solar sources to their energy mix. What problems/benefits have arisen?</p>

<p>How will the system (and the Australian energy market) change as storage is introduced on an increasing scale? Is there an “ideal” size for storage components – a battery at every household or Snowy Hydro 2?</p>

<p>Would large scale adoption of electric vehicles fit in (local storage, demand management) or cause problems?</p>

<p>This is a public meeting: please invite anyone who might be interested.</p>
