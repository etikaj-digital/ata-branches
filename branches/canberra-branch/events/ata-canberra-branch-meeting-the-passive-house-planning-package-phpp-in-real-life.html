        <p><strong>When</strong>: Wednesday 26 October, 2016, 7:30 pm<br />

<strong>Where</strong>: Ian Ross Building, Australian National University, 31 North Road, Acton ACT 2601<br />

<strong>Speakers</strong>: Ralph Frank, Harley Truong and Ian Brumby<br />

<strong>Subject</strong>: The Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) in real life. A comparison between designed and actual performance.</p>

<p>Members of the local chapter of the Australian Passive House association will give a brief introduction to passive house then speak about the build experience and the experience of modelling with PHPP. Measurements have been made on one of the passive houses here in Canberra and these data will be compared with the predictions of the models.<br />

There is a lot happening in the passive house world. For example, the new framework for planning retrofits has been released. These developments will also be discussed before the meeting is opened for discussion and questions.</p>

<p><strong>Harley Truong</strong> is one of Australia\'s most experienced Certified Passive House designers, and specialises in helping clients achieve the rigorous international Passive House standard through energy modelling, component specification, and construction detailing.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Brumby</strong> is an architect with more than 30 years’ experience in the design and documentation of large scale architectural projects. Ian specialises in environmentally responsible design and in the development of thermally efficient buildings, and has a particular interest in Passivhaus design.</p>

<p><strong>Ralph Frank</strong> has been a member of the International Passive House Association (APHA) since 2012, and of the Australian Passive House Association since 2014. Over the last 12 months he has served on the Board of the APHA as Deputy Chair. Ralph is the APHA Canberra Representative and facilitates the monthly APHA Canberra Chapter Meetings.</p>

<p>This is a public meeting: please invite anyone who might be interested.</p>

<p>We hope to see you at the meeting.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The November meeting will be our annual meeting with elections for positions on the branch committee. If you would like to contribute in any way to the running of the branch please consider joining the committee. More details will be in the meeting notice next month.</p>

<p>Regards, ATA Canberra branch<br />
