<p><b>Where: </b>Hawkesbury EarthCare Centre, University of Western Sydney (Cnr Science Rd and Campus Drive) Richmond</p>

<p><b>Cost: </b>$5.00. Afternoon tea provided</p>

<p>Renewable energy technologies are expanding and their costs are continuing to decline, threatening the business models of the electricity industry and the future of the coal industry. As a result, false myths about renewable energy are being disseminated by these industries and their supporters among politicians and the media. This talk will bust some of the principal myths while demonstrating that a renewable energy future is technically and economically feasible for Australia.</p>

<p>Dr Mark Diesendorf is Associate Professor and Deputy Director of the Institute of Environmental Studies at UNSW. He is a member of a team that is researching how to run the Australian electricity system entirely on renewable energy. Previously, at various times, he was a Principal Research Scientist in CSIRO, Professor of Environmental Science and Founding Director of the Institute for Sustainable Futures at UTS, and Director of Sustainability Centre Pty Ltd. His new book, <i>\'Sustainable Energy Solutions for Climate Change\',</i> has just been published and will be available for purchase at the event for a substantially discounted price ($35 cash).</p>
